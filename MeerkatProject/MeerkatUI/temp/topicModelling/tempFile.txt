Depends on how far along the child is, if the pregnancy is not past the first trimester then no it is not taking a life. For it has nothing to be innocent of, it has not yet lived to experience things that would make it innocent or guilty which are both conscious thought processes that a baby does not possess especially as a fetus. A fetus is a parasite, living off of the host until the pregnancy has been full filled and the baby has been birthed. Only then would it be the taking of an innocent life. \n                        But it is going to be life most people regret having abortion. Just because it is not completely formed does not mean it is alive. Why is it not okay to murder a kid at lets say 12 but its okay to kill a baby before it is even born? /n                        "killing a baby is killing an innocent life. Why? well first of all, you don't give the baby a chance to live." If you don't give the "baby" a chance to live, then how can there be a life to kill?                        are you serious it doesn't matter if the baby doesn't have an age or if he / she is 15 you should never be able to kill a life.                        Pretending pro-life people care about scientific fact is bullshit. Not that it's impossible to be scientifically honest and still be pro-life, but so many outspoken pro-life people and groups who have no problem using misinformation, emotional blackmail, intimidation and deceit to manipulate people into doing what pro-life thinks is right. Pro-choice people don't have to lie, because they don't care if no one chooses an abortion as long as they aren't being lied to or bullied. In fact, I think you'd find most pro-choice people would agree that the fewer people need/want abortions, the better. But being dishonest or cruel is not the way to go about making that happen. Why are Dilation and Evacuation illustrations so commonly used for pro-life propaganda when Dilation and Evacuation accounts for less than 5% of all procedures? Not because it's an honest representation of what most abortions look like, because it isn't. It's because it's supposed to be scarier and more guilt-inducing. If you show this picture to an average woman who is considering an abortion and tell her this is what her procedure will look like, you are probably lying to her. You want abortion legalâ€¦on demand period. You got it. Please show me where I denied that a fetus is a human. Oh wait, I didn't, because I'm not an idiot. Of course a fetus is a human- did you expect me to claim it's a different species? The argument for abortion is sometimes concerned with personhood, not the presence of homo sapien DNA and you're getting the two confused. But I think abortion would still be acceptable even if the government extended legal personhood to fetuses. One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out.. Abortion if it's a fetus, murder if it's not. It's cool how there's two different names for that, isn't it? That's so we don't get them confused. Oh shit, really?! Well then call me pro-life! Or don't, because I already knew that. Maybe say some more obvious things. I'm fine with it. It's not pretty but it's a fairly realistic representation of an uncommon medical procedure. Medical procedures generally are not pretty. It's the use of it to scare women who won't even be getting this procedure that I have a problem with. More obvious things! If there is someone here who didn't realize abortion exterminates a living thing, I'm sure they'll thank you.
