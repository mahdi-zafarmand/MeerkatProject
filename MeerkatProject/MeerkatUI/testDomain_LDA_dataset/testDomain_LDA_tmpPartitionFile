Depends on how far along the child is, if the pregnancy is not past the first trimester then no it is not taking a life		doc0
For it has nothing to be innocent of		doc0
it has not yet lived to experience things that would make it innocent or guilty which are both conscious thought processes that a baby does not possess especially as a fetus		doc0
A fetus is a parasite		doc0
living off of the host until the pregnancy has been full filled and the baby has been birthed		doc0
Only then would it be the taking of an innocent life		doc0
\n But it is going to be life most people regret having abortion		doc0
Just because it is not completely formed does not mean it is alive		doc0
Why is it not okay to murder a kid at lets say 12 but its okay to kill a baby before it is even born		doc0
killing a baby is killing an innocent life		doc0
you don't give the baby a chance to live.		doc0
If you don't give the		doc0
baby		doc0
a chance to live, then how can there be a life to kill		doc0
are you serious it doesn't matter if the baby doesn't have an age or if he / she is 15 you should never be able to kill a life		doc0
Pretending pro-life people care about scientific fact is bullshit		doc0
Not that it's impossible to be scientifically honest and still be pro-life		doc0
but so many outspoken pro-life people and groups who have no problem using misinformation		doc0
emotional blackmail, intimidation and deceit to manipulate people into doing what pro-life thinks is right		doc0
Pro-choice people don't have to lie		doc0
because they don't care if no one chooses an abortion as long as they aren't being lied to or bullied		doc0
In fact		doc0
I think you'd find most pro-choice people would agree that the fewer people need/want abortions		doc0
But being dishonest or cruel is not the way to go about making that happen		doc0
Why are Dilation and Evacuation illustrations so commonly used for pro-life propaganda when Dilation and Evacuation accounts for less than 5% of all procedures		doc0
Not because it's an honest representation of what most abortions look like		doc0
because it isn't. It's because it's supposed to be scarier and more guilt-inducing		doc0
If you show this picture to an average woman who is considering an abortion and tell her this is what her procedure will look like, you are probably lying to her		doc0
You want abortion legalâ€¦on demand period		doc0
Please show me where I denied that a fetus is a human		doc0
Oh wait		doc0
I didn't		doc0
because I'm not an idiot		doc0
Of course a fetus is a human- did you expect me to claim it's a different species		doc0
The argument for abortion is sometimes concerned with personhood		doc0
not the presence of homo sapien DNA and you're getting the two confused		doc0
But I think abortion would still be acceptable even if the government extended legal personhood to fetuses		doc0
One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent		doc0
This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties		doc0
If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out		doc0
Abortion if it's a fetus		doc0
murder if it's not		doc0
It's cool how there's two different names for that		doc0
isn't it		doc0
That's so we don't get them confused		doc0
Oh shit		doc0
Well then call me pro-life		doc0
Or don't		doc0
because I already knew that		doc0
Maybe say some more obvious things		doc0
I'm fine with it		doc0
It's not pretty but it's a fairly realistic representation of an uncommon medical procedure		doc0
Medical procedures generally are not pretty		doc0
It's the use of it to scare women who won't even be getting this procedure that I have a problem with		doc0
More obvious things		doc0
If there is someone here who didn't realize abortion exterminates a living thing, I'm sure they'll thank you.		doc0
