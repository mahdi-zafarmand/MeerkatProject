								<h1>Meerkat Application Back-End</h1>
								<p>
									This document is an introduction to design and use of the classes in the back-end division of the 
									Meerkat application. None of the classes in this repository have any interaction with GUI and their are
									all called through an appropriate method in the API.								
								</p>                    	
                    	</div>
                    	<div id="datastructure"></div>
                    		<h1>Data Structure</h1>
                        <p>
                        Meerkat has a core data structure that contains data structure for graphs 
                        as well as messagelyft s in a thread.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Graph Data Structure</h2>
                        <p>
                        The graph data structure is split into interfaces and implementation.
                        all around the repository we use the interface except for place 
                        where we want to create an object such as <code>IVertex v = new Vertex(/*parameters*/)</code>
                        all interfaces start with the capital letter <code>I</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Important interfaces are as follows:
                        <ul>
                        	<li><code>IGraph<V,E></code>: interface responsible for basic functionalities of graph - Generic: type of vertices and Edges</li>
                        	<li><code>IGraphElement</code>: interface for common functionalities of edges and vertices</li>
                        	<li><code>IVertex</code>: interface responsible for vertex specific functionalities</li>
                        	<li><code>IEdge<V></code>: interface responsible for edge especific functionalities - Generic: type of vertices (source and destination)</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
								for each of the above interfaces we have a class implementing that interfance 
								<code>(Graph, GraphElement, Vertex, and Edge)</code>
								<br>
								we also have <code>DynamicGraph</code> as a subclass of <code>Graph</code>.
								Since we need to keep extra information such as <code>timestamps</code> for dynamic graphs,
								we should have a different implementation for that.
								<br>
								<code>TODO: interface for DynamicGraph has to be added to datastructure/core/graph/classinterface</code>                      
                        </p>
                        <h2>Text Data Structure</h2>
                        <p>
								The other package in the <code>datastructure.core</code> package is <code>datastructure.core.text</code>.
								Text package includes data structure for representing message threads.
								In the text package we have three classes as follows:
								<ul>
									<li><code>HNode</code>: any kind of abstract or non-abstract message in the flow of the thread.</li>
									<li><code>MsgNode<A,L,C></code>: a subclass of HNode that contains information about Author, Location, Content, and Date as well.</li>
									<li><code>AnalyzedMsg</code>: a wrapper for a message to keep the results of sentiment analysis or emotion analysis there as well. 
									This class will only be used by sentiment/emotion analysis algorithms/classes</li>								
								</ul>
                        </p>
                        <h2>Common classes for all data structures</h2>
                        <p>
									<ul>
										<li><code>Attributable</code>: Attribute manager for any class</li>
										<li><code>Identifiable</code>: assigns ids to the instance of the class. the unique MeerkatId.</li>
										<li><code>Weighable</code>: Weight managet for any class</li>
										<li><code>Selectable</code>: <code>form old cold and related to selecting elements(vertices & edges) in the GUI</code></li>									
									</ul>  
									<code>Attributable.java</code> contains two different implementation of the interface <code>Attributer</code>:
									<ul>
										<li><code>GenericAttributer</code>: called as <code>userAttributer</code> in data structures, is used to save attributes of entities (vertex, edge, graph, ...) which are provided in the input file</li>
										<li><code>SystemAttributer</code>: is used to save Meerkat generated values such as the results of algorithms for each entity.</li>									
									</ul>
									For all <code>System Attributes</code>, we use the date that the attribute was computed . This way each time user
									request for that value, we need to check that date with the latest change in our data. If the value is 
									update, we need not to run the algorithm again (because it takes a lot of time for some algorithms, it's better
									to avoid running them when it is not necessary).                      
                        </p>
                        <p>Make sure to keep all page content within the <code>#page-content-wrapper</code>.</p>
                        <h2>More Complicated Data Stucture(s)</h2>
                        <p>
									If for any kind of development purposes, developer needs to have a more complicated data structure,
									dependable on the data (not the algorithms), s/he can define her/his required data structure as a wrapper
									around core data structure.
									<br>
									For example if in future we want to have a data structure specific to twitter, we will add the package
									<code>datastructure.twitter</code> for our required purpose. But in case of using these wrappers as
									the main datastrucutre in the whole application and having specific connections with GUI, developer
									needs to create an appropriate Project (such as TwitterProject) in the <code>project</code> package as well.                        
                        </p>
                    	<div id="algorithms">
                    		<h1>Algorithms</h1>
								<p>                
								Algorithms in Meerkat are of one of the following kinds:    		
                    		<ul>
									<li>Community Mining Algorithms</li>
									<li>Graph Algorithms</li>
									<li>Layout Algorithms</li>
									<li>Text Analysis Algorithm</li>                    		
                    		</ul>
                    		The class <code>Algorithm</code> is the superclass for any algorithm that we have. <code>Algorithm extends Thread</code>.
                    		Thus, all our algorithms would be a thread. Therefore, for running the algorithm, we should call the method <code>run</code>.
                    		In cases when user wants to stop an algorithm, we call the <code>terminate</code> method.
                    		<br>
                    		Two important point to remeber about all algorithms is that, when the algorithm is called by user (constructed in back-end),
                    		we will set a <code>dtCallTime</code> field in the <code>algorithm.Algorithm</code>.
                    		<br>
                    		The next important fact is, when the algorithm is done, if we want to save the result of the algorithm to our
                    		data structure, we need to call <code>updateDataStructure</code> method. This method (<code>updateDataStructre</code>),
                    		should be implemented for all algorithms and should be a <code>synchronized</code> method. Because we do not want
                    		to different threads to update the same attribute, which may cause by some of the algorithms.
                    		</p>
                    		<h2>Community Mining Algorithms</h2>
                    		<p>
                    		All community mining algorithms, should extends <code>Miner.java</code>. They all would be constructed by an 
                    		instance of <code>IGraph</code> and the the <code>run</code> method is called on the instance.
                    		Most of the community mining algorithms are migrated well to the latest version of our design. The status would
                    		be as follows:
                    		<ul>
									<li><code>AttributeValueMiner : DONE</code></li>
									<li><code>DynamicMine : TO BE DONE</code></li>
									<li><code>FastModularityMiner : TO BE DONE</code></li>
									<li><code>HierarchicalCommunityExtractor : TO BE DONE</code></li>
									<li><code>Indexer : this is not a CM Alg. It is using by one of the non-migrated ones.</code></li>
									<li><code>KMeansMine : TO BE DONE</code></li>
									<li><code>LocalCommunityMiner : DONE</code></li>
									<li><code>LocalT : DONE</code></li>
									<li><code>LocalTopLeader : DONE</code></li>
									<li><code>RosvallInfomapMiner : DONE</code></li>
									<li><code>RosvallInfomodMiner : DONE</code></li>                  		
                    		</ul>
                    		
                    		</p>
                    		<h2>Graph Algorithms</h2>
                    		<p>
                    		All graph algorithms are reimplemented from the scratch since we were using jung implementation for
                    		them in pervious versions of Meerkat Application.
								Graph algorithms contain <code>ConnectedComponents</code> to compute connected components. <br>
								Shortest path algorithms in the package <code>algorithm.graph.shortestpath</code>. Currently we have
								only implemented Dijkstra shortest path algorithm, but we can add more algorithms depending on usage. <br>
								And finally we have <code>algorithm.graph.metric</code> package that contains algorithms for computing 
								scores for nodes in the graph as follows:
								<ul>
									<li><code>Betweenness</code>: computes vertex betweenness centrality.</li>
									<li><code>Closemess</code>: computes closeness centrality.</li>
									<li><code>HITS</code>: computes hub and authority score.</li>
									<li><code>Hub</code>: gets hub score from HITS result.</li>
									<li><code>Authority</code>: gets authority score from HITS result.</li>
									<li><code>InDegree</code>: computes indegree centrality.</li>
									<li><code>OutDegree</code>: computes outdegree centrality.</li>
									<li><code>PageRank</code>: computes pagerank centrality.</li>
									<li><code>NodePositionMetric</code>: TO BE DONE</li>
									<li><code>NormalizedAlphaCentrality</code>: TO BE DONE</li>								
								</ul>
                    		</p>
                    		
                    		<h2>Layout Algorithms</h2>
                    		<p>
								All migrated layout algorithms can be find in <code>algorithm.layout.algorithms</code>. The classes within
								<code>algorithm.layout</code> are those which are not migrated yet.
								<br>
								All migrated layout algorithms have been implemented from the scratch by developers in Meerkat team.
								The list of migrated classes are as follows:
								<ul>
									<li><code>RandomLayout</code>: assigns random positions to vertices.</li>		
									<li><code>CircleLayout</code>: sets vertices around a circle</li>	
									<li><code>ModifiedFRLayout</code>: FR algorithm modified by Justin, one of previous developers.</li>	
									<li><code>COMCLayout</code>: puts vertices in different areas based on their community.</li>	
									<li><code>Bullseye</code>: puts nodes in a spiral circle based on their score computed by one of the metric algorithms</li>								
								</ul>                     		
								All layout algorithms extend <code>Layout.java</code>, Layout.java is also used to call the appropriate Layout Class
								upon user's request (click). The reflection part, takes place in Layout.java as well.
								<br>
								An important point: All layout algorithms assume the size of the canvas is 1 * 1 (unit square) and scaling would
								take place in GUI depending of the canvas size, window size, zooming level, and so forth.
                    		</p>
                    		
                    		<h2>Text Analysis Algorithms</h2>
                    		<p>
								Text similarity classes as well as sentiment anallysis package reside in <code>algorithm.textanalysis</code>.                    		
                    		</p>
                    		
                    		<h2>Algorithms Util</h2>
                    		<p>
								some utility algorithms including <code>Sort</code> and <code>PlainTextParser</code> are currently in this package.

							A project can contain multiple graphs, or multiple thread tree message lists. Thus, each project can be linked to
							multiple data files on disk as well Meerkat generated graphs from loaded data (either text or graph itself).

							The class <code>config.MeerkatClassConfig</code> loads the mapping between function id to class name. The function id
							is the same used in GUI. Thus, when GUI wants to send backend a task to do, it will send the id and the mapping
							with the proper class in done with the help of <code>MeerkatClassConfig.java</code>.
							<br>
							The other class <code>config.MeerkatSystem.java</code>, contains all constant and configurational information,
							such as directory for some outsource algorithms or system attributes to add to data structure in order to save
