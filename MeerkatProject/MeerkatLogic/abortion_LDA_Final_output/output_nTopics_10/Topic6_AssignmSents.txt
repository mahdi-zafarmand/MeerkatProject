<assignment document=90 sentence=20 > this is an issue of whether you would consider abortion as murder or not</assignment>
<assignment document=90 sentence=21 > you yourself seem to think that this issue is paramount to the debate since you went on to talk about the legalisation of murder and used that as an analogy</assignment>
