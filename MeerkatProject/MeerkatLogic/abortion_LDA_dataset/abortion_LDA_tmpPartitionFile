Depends on how far along the child is, if the pregnancy is not past the first trimester then no it is not taking a life		doc0
For it has nothing to be innocent of		doc0
it has not yet lived to experience things that would make it innocent or guilty which are both conscious thought processes that a baby does not possess especially as a fetus		doc0
A fetus is a parasite		doc0
living off of the host until the pregnancy has been full filled and the baby has been birthed		doc0
Only then would it be the taking of an innocent life.		doc0
But it is going to be life most people regret having abortion		doc1
Just because it is not completely formed does not mean it is alive		doc1
Why is it not okay to murder a kid at lets say 12 but its okay to kill a baby before it is even born?		doc1
killing a baby is killing an innocent life		doc2
you don't give the baby a chance to live.		doc2
If you don't give the		doc2
baby		doc2
a chance to live, then how can there be a life to kill?		doc2
are you serious it doesn't matter if the baby doesn't have an age or if he / she is 15 you should never be able to kill a life		doc3
An embryo and foetus are not lives		doc4
A life has a developed brain and body		doc4
The best argument you can make is that 10% of abortions might involve a foetus that is on the brink of being a life.		doc4
Because the 12-year old is aware		doc5
it is alive		doc5
A foetus when aborted 40% of the time isn't alive		doc5
It doesn't have a heart		doc5
50% of the time it doesn't have a brain.		doc5
so what if it doesn't have a brain yet still is going to get one and still has a whole future in front of him/her.		doc6
It will still come to feel pain		doc7
think comprehend		doc7
and has more life ahead of him/her then a 12 year old.		doc7
It's definitely dishonest to present this as a picture of abortion in general		doc8
and sadly it preys on people who have no better source of information		doc8
Most women will not have abortions using this procedure		doc8
and their fetuses will not look at all like that		doc8
They probably will not even be recognizably human		doc8
If a woman went to a clinic, she would at least be told the truth about what would happen to her if she wanted an abortion		doc8
D&E;is still in use today although it counts for a small fraction of all procedures		doc8
Abortions aren't pretty		doc8
no matter how they're done		doc8
If you are pro-choice, you may have to accept the fact that they are just tough for laypeople to look at		doc8
even suction aspiration		doc8
It's not at all a point in favor of pro-life		doc8
childbirth and open-heart surgery can turn stomachs		doc8
What could we show that you would find acceptable as the picture of abortion		doc9
You people do not care about medical facts		doc9
scientific facts		doc9
IT DOES NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST TO YOU		doc9
You want abortion legal…on demand period		doc9
The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING		doc9
THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT		doc9
The heart starts beating around 22 days…		doc9
THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT		doc9
Now I know what our laws say…that killing should be an option for women		doc9
But tell me….what would you call killing a living human being without its permission		doc9
The unborn can't speak for themselves		doc9
It does not matter what the procedure is…it outcome is the same thing		doc9
Death to the unborn		doc9
It is killing by burning		doc9
scrapping, dismembering		doc9
vacuuming the child until its dead		doc9
That is every abortionists goal		doc9
The unborn has to be killed in the womb….not outside		doc9
This picture is accurate and shows abortion		doc9
Those who are pro-abortion of course would not like this pic….it puts action to reality…it gives a face to what they condone		doc9
And what they condone is barbaric		doc9
This is a surgery or procedure that is like none else on earth		doc9
Most doctors try to save lives		doc9
And abortionists kill lives.		doc9
Pretending pro-life people care about scientific fact is bullshit		doc10
Not that it's impossible to be scientifically honest and still be pro-life		doc10
but so many outspoken pro-life people and groups who have no problem using misinformation		doc10
emotional blackmail, intimidation and deceit to manipulate people into doing what pro-life thinks is right		doc10
Pro-choice people don't have to lie		doc10
because they don't care if no one chooses an abortion as long as they aren't being lied to or bullied		doc10
In fact		doc10
I think you'd find most pro-choice people would agree that the fewer people need/want abortions		doc10
But being dishonest or cruel is not the way to go about making that happen		doc10
Why are D&E;illustrations so commonly used for pro-life propaganda when D&E;accounts for less than 5% of all procedures		doc10
Not because it's an honest representation of what most abortions look like		doc10
because it isn't. It's because it's supposed to be scarier and more guilt-inducing		doc10
If you show this picture to an average woman who is considering an abortion and tell her this is what her procedure will look like, you are probably lying to her		doc10
(I'm not the one putting the semicolon after D&E;		doc10
the website is doing that.) You want abortion legal…on demand period		doc10
Please show me where I denied that a fetus is a human		doc10
Oh wait		doc10
I didn't		doc10
because I'm not an idiot		doc10
Of course a fetus is a human- did you expect me to claim it's a different species		doc10
The argument for abortion is sometimes concerned with personhood		doc10
not the presence of homo sapien DNA and you're getting the two confused		doc10
But I think abortion would still be acceptable even if the government extended legal personhood to fetuses		doc10
One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent		doc10
This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties		doc10
If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out		doc10
Abortion if it's a fetus		doc10
murder if it's not		doc10
It's cool how there's two different names for that		doc10
isn't it		doc10
That's so we don't get them confused		doc10
Oh shit		doc10
Well then call me pro-life		doc10
Or don't		doc10
because I already knew that		doc10
Maybe say some more obvious things		doc10
I'm fine with it		doc10
It's not pretty but it's a fairly realistic representation of an uncommon medical procedure		doc10
Medical procedures generally are not pretty		doc10
It's the use of it to scare women who won't even be getting this procedure that I have a problem with		doc10
More obvious things		doc10
If there is someone here who didn't realize abortion exterminates a living thing, I'm sure they'll thank you.		doc10
I've agreed with a lot of your argument		doc11
but I'm particularly disturbed at the part where		doc11
This line of thinking is rational		doc11
but some women would use it to justify promiscuity		doc11
I believe in abortion in cases where:- the mother and/or father are too young to support a child		doc11
or the mother and/or father are in a situation that would not be a positive environment for a child (ie		doc11
abusive relationship(s), poverty/homelessness, etc.);- the mother's/fetus's life is at risk,- the fetus is the result of a rape or incestuous encounter;- the fetus has a very high chance of developing some debilitating disease/malformation that will make its developing life difficult		doc11
In women who are promiscuous and take no time to learn about/use contraceptives		doc11
they should not use abortion as a Plan B. If they are not ready for a child, and plan to have sex		doc11
then they should learn more responsibility and practice safe sex		doc11
not just assume they won't get pregnant.		doc11
Admit you're killing a baby		doc12
shit happens		doc12
it's your choice		doc12
These pro-lifers then		doc12
they better be cranking out a baby every time the female produces an egg		doc12
By not fertilizing that egg		doc12
you are in fact preventing life to live		doc12
Are you a dick		doc12
Preventing a life to live		doc12
killing a life		doc12
whats teh difference		doc12
You have the power of God either way.		doc12
What did this guy just say		doc13
It's a simple choice		doc13
are you ok with killing a baby while it's growing in the mother		doc13
"stuff		doc13
Move on		doc13
just admitt you're killing and say		doc13
"I'm pro-choice". You killed 1000 bugs on your way to work		doc13
you're a killer anyway		doc13
live with it		doc13
Let humans decide.		doc13
His mental state is of no consequence		doc14
His point is valid		doc14
Abortion is ending a human life		doc14
Pro-choice condones abortions		doc14
therefore pro-choice condones the killing of human lives		doc14
You either accept that or you don't.		doc14
You have not made any argument for whether or not abortion should be considered morally wrong or not		doc15
So even if we were to dismiss his mental state and even if we were to accept that abortion ends a human life (which I wouldn't be inclined to do)		doc15
we have no reason to believe that abortion is morally wrong.		doc15
Pro-aborts have a big problem		doc16
They celebrate abortion but don't want the label that goes with it		doc16
They don't want people to think they condone killing…. And your right…		doc16
they probably feel worse about killing those bugs with their cars…then they do living human beings.		doc16
What is false about anything I have posted concerning abortion		doc17
This issue is a piece of cake		doc17
Let science and medicine speak the truth		doc17
The truth is…from conception that which is in the womb is alive		doc17
Most abortions happen after the heart starts beating		doc17
"In the third month		doc17
your baby is the size of a small apple and is fully formed		doc17
She has grown from 1 to 3 inches and weighs about 1 ½ ounces by month end		doc17
Her head now sits on her neck and you can even see the whorl of a hair pattern on the top of her head		doc17
Her head is still very large and makes up half the length of her body		doc17
Her eyes are moving closer together and her ears are continuing to form		doc17
She has taste buds and has developed the sucking reflex		doc17
She is beginning to practice her swallowing too		doc17
Teeth buds have also begun to form		doc17
as well as fingernails and toenails		doc17
Her major organs, as well as her sex organs have formed and are developing steadily		doc17
Your placenta has now developed and has taken over hormone production.		doc17
Most abortions happen around this gestational age		doc17
Wow a lot happening eh		doc17
It is not just a glob of tissue		doc17
THIS IS FACT		doc17
Why can't you pro-aborts just admit it		doc17
However barbaric…abortion should be celebrated and should be allowed…however horrendous it is		doc17
You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions		doc17
You are blind to what the truth says.		doc17
Even if it may seem horrendous, it does not necessarily imply that it ought not to be allowed or done		doc18
All you have done here is simply appeal to emotion and given no logical arguments for your position		doc18
If a mother is definitely going to die very slowly and painfully if the baby is not aborted, is it more immoral to abort the baby or allow the mother to die a slow and agonising death		doc18
Let me raise another scenario		doc18
What if a minor was impregnated by a violent rape and the rapist does not take responsibility for the child		doc18
Is it more immoral to leave a defenceless and helpless minor to care for a baby		doc18
a constant psychological reminder of rape, or for her to abort		doc18
I'm not talking about who you would have more sympathy for		doc18
but merely on what moral grounds do you have to say abortion is immoral		doc18
By logic		doc18
you yourself have no good reason to be opposed to abortion.		doc18
First of all, you further the previous point made about disinformation in how the quote you posted uses 'she' instead of 'they'		doc19
attempting to personify the foetus further than it should be		doc19
Every single part of your body can be considered alive		doc19
except your nails and hair and a few others, I believe		doc19
Cutting off a piece of skin holds no moral issues for you		doc19
I would guess		doc19
it's a similar idea		doc19
Except a foetus will cost thousands of pounds/dollars/euros		doc19
will take thousands of hours of time		doc19
will restrict you throughout your entire life		doc19
cause you to be labelled because of it		doc19
and cause you to endure a huge amount of hardship from it		doc19
There are reasons for abortion as well		doc19
studies have shown that about three quarters of women choose them because of financial reasons		doc19
hardly their choice		doc19
Why can't you pro-aborts just admit it I think you'll have to look very hard to find someone who is actually pro abortion		doc19
I've definitely never met someone who openly admits to that		doc19
It's pro-choice		doc19
humans kill thousands of life forms every single second		doc19
just because it's seen as morally wrong there is a big issue with abortion		doc19
Why should it be morally wrong		doc19
Please give me a reason why it is so intrinsically bad to take a life with no emotion		doc19
I would suggest that Pro-Lifer's are not necessarily blind to truth		doc19
they simply ignore the truth of what happens to those who are not allowed abortions		doc19
Abortion rates does not change massively when it is outlawed		doc19
all that happens is they do it illegally and unsafely		doc19
the argument made by Republican candidates is that abortion should be outlawed to protect the 'nuclear family'. Hardly relevant		doc19
as typical, married, happy		doc19
nuclear families would not get abortions a significant amount of the time		doc19
Give me a convincing argument as to why abortion is so bad.		doc19
Anyone who is pro-choice is pro-abortion…there is no difference		doc20
They don't like the label however but its the truth		doc20
I just got banned from a place because I refused to stop using the term pro-abort to describe someone who …DOES NOT WANT LEGAL PROTECTION FOR THE LIVING HUMAN BEING IN THE WOMB		doc20
This is not a pro-life person		doc20
This is a person who even though they might not get an abortion themselves…is willing to sit by quietly while others kill in the name of CHOICE		doc20
THEY ARE PRO-ABORTS		doc20
I can just see someone at a Right to Life convention…standing up and saying….		doc20
I am pro-life but believe that women should have the choice to kill.		doc20
They would be laughed out of the room		doc20
There is no difference between someone who is pro-abortion and someone who is pro-choice…they want the same thing….legalized killing		doc20
Cutting off a piece of skin….compared to stopping a beating heart of a human in the womb…		doc20
you think is the same thing		doc20
Laughable…won't even comment		doc20
You probably no doubt think that killing a bug is the same as killing a human being….hey they are both alive right		doc20
Yes babies are costly		doc20
How much did your parents foot the bill for your maintenance		doc20
At least your mother allowed you life…and you are here debating and defending the rights of other mothers…to kill		doc20
to take away the rights of others		doc20
What is it that Ronald Reagan said…it was so true		doc20
Question….I know you are pro-abortion		doc20
Do you believe the a woman has the right to kill throughout the entire nine months		doc20
Oh I can't wait to see just how many rights you give women….to own their bodies		doc20
Why is abortion bad you ask		doc20
and I quote…."		doc20
What is wrong with owning the label		doc20
You tell me what is wrong with being called pro-abortion		doc20
Is there something wrong with abortion Ben		doc20
If there is…then why do you support it		doc20
If there isn't…why isn't the label ok		doc20
LOL		doc20
Ok, I'm amazed you're actually being this ridiculous about a simple name		doc21
Pro abortion means you want abortions		doc21
Pro choice means you want the choice of abortions		doc21
There is a big difference		doc21
I do not like that people get abortions		doc21
I simply think it's the lesser evil of two		doc21
especially when you look at statistics that show that abortion laws don't stop abortions		doc21
they just stop safe abortions		doc21
This leads to major risks to both the baby and the mother		doc21
It's common for pro lifers to accuse pro-choice supporters of being blind to the facts		doc21
when it is they who rarely actually consider the women that they're condemning		doc21
I think it's bad		doc21
I'm asking you why it's so bad		doc21
You haven't answered any of my questions		doc21
you've simply said that it's bad and that it's the same as pro-abort		doc21
Please talk about questions that are actually up for debate		doc21
you're wasting your time		doc21
attacking something that isn't there		doc21
Useless circular rhetoric		doc21
sounds clever		doc21
but it proves nothing.		doc21
And people who are pro-choice want abortions legal		doc22
They want laws in place that give the woman the option of killing		doc22
And if we had a nationwide vote…and a pro choicer voted…which would he vote…		doc22
Pro-choice abortion or no abortion		doc22
So you think abortion is bad…but yet you want it legal so others can do it		doc22
LOL Abortion is taking a life and that is bad		doc22
Abortion procedures are inhumane,,,we don't even do it on animals like we do humans		doc22
Nothing is good about abortion		doc22
Now I know why you won't answer the …do you believe the woman has the right to kill throughout her entire pregnancy		doc22
Because if yes…then wow…you look terrible even to the pro-choicers who use viability as an excuse,,,and if no…then you enslave the woman and your excuse that abortion should be legal because its the woman's body and should be her decision….is shot down		doc22
What is it….answer the question		doc22
I am debating your position on this and need to know		doc22
Are you afraid to answer		doc22
It proves that you were blessed with life…		doc22
circular or not		doc22
The statement Reagan made is true		doc22
We are given life		doc22
liberty and the pursuit of happiness in our Constitution….but without life we can't have the others		doc22
And we deny that which is in the womb the things you and I take for granted.		doc22
They don't want abortions		doc23
they want the option		doc23
LOL Yes		doc23
pretty much		doc23
I think religion is bad		doc23
but I'd never consider taking it away from people		doc23
I think war is bad		doc23
but it can still be valid		doc23
I think people being a dick is bad		doc23
but I think it is their right		doc23
There's lots of things I don't like that I would still support		doc23
Just as Voltaire said 'I disapprove of what but I will defend to the death your right to say it'		doc23
I feel the same way about abortion		doc23
Nothing is good about abortion		doc23
That's not true		doc23
Without being an expert in biology		doc23
I'm leaning towards a 'first trimester' option		doc23
to me that seems to be the commonly accepted medical grounds		doc23
Makes sense		doc23
after that the foetus becomes too lifelike		doc23
and the emotional trauma is too great		doc23
how could you possibly give her the right the whole way through		doc23
when she's in labour, that's ridiculously impossible		doc23
A time limit makes sense		doc23
I am not American		doc23
Please do not assume that everyone you meet on the internet is American		doc23
especially when I've written so in my 'about me'. Yes		doc23
but the constitution is a legal document		doc23
it can easily be flawed		doc23
Just because it's there doesn't make it right		doc23
you must verify what		doc23
if you did accept it as truth		doc23
that only applies to citizens		doc23
When a foetus has citizenship		doc23
it gains the right to life		doc23
it must be born		doc23
another circular impossibility, can't gain protection unless it's born		doc23
when it doesn't need protection.		doc23
No, a baby has been born		doc24
An unborn		doc24
undeveloped foetus, is not a baby.		doc24
Well really, it's they're choice what they wanna do		doc25
Not saying it's the right thing to actually do		doc25
but it's not our choice		doc25
If they don't want the baby, then they don't have the baby		doc25
Simple as that		doc25
that baby that was aborted could have been the next president or maybe the next singer everyone talks about.		doc25
I've yet to see anyone ask a pro-lifer this question		doc26
what if a fifteen year old girl is raped		doc26
impregnated, and still in school and her parents are unable to support the baby		doc26
while the rapist is never caught		doc26
2. Many abortions take place because a family cannot support the baby		doc26
or the baby will have some sort of mental disorder to prevent him/her from living life to the fullest		doc26
would the baby be better off in a world where society discriminates against the mentally challenged		doc26
or better in Heaven where things will be perfect and the baby can be taken care of?		doc26
You are ignoring the fact that most abortions are for convenience		doc27
not rape or any medical need		doc27
The most common reasons women consider abortion are		doc27
Per webmd.com		doc27
The most common reasons women consider abortion are		doc27
1. Birth control (contraceptive) failure		doc27
Over half of all women who have an abortion used a contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant.2 Inability to support or care for a child		doc27
3. To end an unwanted pregnancy		doc27
4. To prevent the birth of a child with birth defects or severe medical problems		doc27
Such defects are often unknown until routine second-trimester tests are done.5. Pregnancy resulting from rape or incest		doc27
6. Physical or mental conditions that endanger the woman's health if the pregnancy is continued		doc27
If the pro-life community were to all agree today that all rape victims should be given abortions (if desired) and then loved without reservation until they are (somewhat) whole again, the pro-abortion industry would give not one inch on their opposition to any restrictions on unlimited abortions		doc27
The 'pregnant rape victim' is a red herring		doc27
meant only to emotionalize the issue in their favor.		doc27
I would be more than happy answering this question		doc28
1. Rape is a violent crime		doc28
a violent act		doc28
The rapist should be caught and serve punishment		doc28
The woman is the victim for sure		doc28
And the child she might be carrying also is a victim		doc28
ESPECIALLY IF SHE THINKS TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT AND DECIDES TO KILL IT		doc28
There is always adoption		doc28
In most communities there are Crisis Pregnancy Centers that help women in situations like this		doc28
Free medical care…etc		doc28
2. What right do you have to presume you know how someone will life and what quality of life the person might have		doc28
You have no right		doc28
Oprah came from a household that was poor		doc28
she was also a victims of abuse		doc28
One of the most successful and rich women in the country		doc28
in the world		doc28
There is no family…that does not suffer bad things		doc28
There are families with drug and alcohol users		doc28
families who are poor		doc28
divorced…no family skates through life with no trials		doc28
Support is an excuse…because there is adoption and there are services that help women who have no money		doc28
How dare you imply that all mentally challenged people be aborted		doc28
Wow		doc28
Hitler had the same mentality and views as your imply here		doc28
My brother in law is mentally handicapped and he brings joy into our lives		doc28
ARe you perfect		doc28
Maybe you should have been aborted…????		doc28
ARE you good looking		doc28
a millionaire….problemless		doc28
I doubt it		doc28
What you imply here is outrageous		doc28
If babies would be better off dead…because they will be in heaven…then lets kill all children…there would not be a population problem is we did this…we would go extinct		doc28
Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?		doc28
Abortion is wrong because it takes a life		doc29
The child in the raped woman's body…how is he/she at fault		doc29
Why should they lose their life because an act of violence happened to another living human being		doc29
Do you think two wrongs make a right		doc29
Rape was wrong….but abortion solves and takes away that problem		doc29
Its two acts of violence….the rape and the abortion		doc29
Abortion is wrong whether the woman was raped or not		doc29
If you think all life is sacred then how could I think less of the baby whose mother was raped		doc29
Red Herring		doc29
It is fact and she has openly talked about her life		doc29
Should she have been aborted simply because she had shady relatives…or that they were poor		doc29
Are you telling me that there are families that have not endured sadness		doc29
death, dying, troubles		doc29
Wow		doc29
Nothing bad happened to them		doc29
Incredible		doc29
You skipped over cleverly my question let me reword it		doc29
Do you think that mentally challenged		doc29
physically challenged people should have been aborted		doc29
If it is known that they are not normal…and what is normal anyway…		doc29
should they be aborted		doc29
yes or no You certainly don't like answering questions when your back is against the wall do you…lmao		doc29
I will against ask the question……Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it		doc29
Your lack of an answer…speaks volumes		doc29
LOL		doc29
There is only one question when it comes to abortion		doc30
If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life		doc30
I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being		doc30
The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human		doc30
Roe vs Wade was a very poor decision by the Supreme Court because it introduce a major contradiction in the law		doc30
The unjustified taking of a human life is considered murder under current law and we have different degrees to further define it		doc30
Consider the fact that if you kill a woman with child		doc30
you will be charged for two counts of homicide		doc30
But if a doctor kills only one of those persons		doc30
no charge		doc30
The Supreme Court by their ruling overturned the law they were supposed to uphold		doc30
The right thing to do would be to overturn this erroneous ruling and restore our rule of law.		doc30
So a thirteen year old girl gets raped		doc31
and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby		doc31
I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby		doc31
and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted		doc31
Surely that is justification enough		doc31
That is not a life anyone would want		doc31
and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do		doc31
think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned		doc31
the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number		doc31
and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become		doc31
Where would they get the money to look after so many children		doc31
Our taxes		doc31
It would get rediculous		doc31
and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born		doc31
I do realise that there are problems with abortion		doc31
for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous		doc31
I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own		doc31
I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion		doc31
when do you begin to class a fetus as a human		doc31
I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks		doc31
It doesnt even enter the fetal stage untill the 11th week		doc31
surely abortion before this stage is not inhumane		doc31
If there was a contraception out there that was 100% effective, then this would be a more valid arguement		doc31
I'm young		doc31
and have dreams and aspirations that I could never fulfill if I became pregnant		doc31
If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one		doc31
You're view seems to be very black and white		doc31
and you seem to dismiss the huge grey area that exists		doc31
Abortion exists for a reason and should not be banned		doc31
To your first point		doc32
What you are arguing for is the view known in German as		doc32
Lebensunwertes Leben or The Life Unworthy of Life		doc32
This was the philosophy that drove the Holocaust of Nazi Germany and the one currently underway here in America		doc32
To learn more about this follow this link Life_unworthy_of_life Why do I say this		doc32
Because you take a class of humans and then give reasons( very poor ones) of why they should not be allowed to live		doc32
In Nazi Germany they said		doc32
This human should not live because of X. And that this human should not live because of X. There is a direct correlation here and I hope you see it		doc32
When you get a chance also pick up the book From Darwin to Hitler by Dr		doc32
Richard Weikart Now to your question of At the moment of conception		doc32
Because at that point you now have a complete and distinct human DNA in the cell		doc32
humans produce humans and dogs produce dogs		doc32
About a contraception that is 100% effective every time		doc32
It's known as abstinence		doc32
Practice it faithfully and you will never get pregnant or an STD		doc32
Fail to practice it and pay the price with your life and possibly that of your child's. And if you do have an unwanted pregnancy		doc32
Please consider adoption		doc32
Did you know that 1 out of every 6 couples are infertile		doc32
Do the math		doc32
that's a lot of couples who want to have children and can't. And I'm one of them		doc32
It cost me 14,000 dollars to have my daughter and it tears me up inside to know that some parents just discard their children like trash		doc32
There are thousands of us out here who are screaming		doc32
please don't kill it		doc32
You'd also be surprised to know the high number of Americans who adopt from over seas		doc32
There aren't enough children to be adopted here because of abortion		doc32
You noted well that I see this issue as black and white		doc32
It's called moral clarity		doc32
When looking at evil I call it as it is		doc32
evil		doc32
Final thought		doc32
Were you ever a fetus		doc32
Then you have to acknowledge that if your mother would have had an abortion it would have ended your life		doc32
not something else, but your life		doc32
Think about that and look at it real hard because that's what abortion does		doc32
it ends the life of a human being in the early stages of development		doc32
And if you were born after 1972		doc32
I challenge you to consider yourself a Survivor of the Abortion Holocaust		doc32
1/3 of your generation has been killed by abortion in America!		doc32
life unworthy of life", it's actually		doc33
POTENTIAL life!		doc33
Until the fetus can actually survive outside of the womb		doc33
it's a living organ like any other organ inside the woman's body		doc33
Once it reaches the stage of about 20 weeks when it should stand a slight chance of survival and maturing into a person		doc33
then it should be made illegal		doc33
But before that time		doc33
it only has the POTENTIAL		doc33
A potential is just that.		doc33
Then why does it have it's own unique DNA		doc34
And what's the point of the fetal sack		doc34
Why all the complex systems to isolate the fetus from the mothers body		doc34
No serious doctor holds this position		doc34
the data doesn't remotely support it		doc34
Once it reaches the stage I did have it right when I said your view decides when a life is worthy of life and when a life is unworthy of life		doc34
You just said it right there		doc34
And here is a list of all the words you use in making this distinction		doc34
And about this notion of		doc34
potential life!		doc34
by all the standard definitions of life, it's alive and has been throughout		doc34
potentiality is a farce		doc34
And finally were do you get this arbitrary standard of survival and person hood		doc34
You see I don't discriminate		doc34
If it's human, and it is		doc34
then it deserves our full protection		doc34
The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be the womb.		doc34
Having its own DNA and all the systems that isolate it from the mother's body does not change the fact that it's completely a part of the mother		doc35
It will not amount to anything if it's detached from her		doc35
but at 20 weeks' gestation a fetus is still a person		doc35
The fact that society may be able to save it without its mother does not automatically make it a person		doc35
It's still so very far from actually entering personhood		doc35
I don't know where you get your definition		doc35
but until it has a fully functional		doc35
self-sustaining biological system and is not attached to another life via the umbilical cord		doc35
I'm going to regard it as potential		doc35
It's not arbitrary		doc35
it's fact		doc35
Me and a lot of other people hold this view		doc35
We make the laws to help us with our lives		doc35
At the moment		doc35
we don't actually need to ban abortion cos doing that doesn't actually help		doc35
and your argument that abortion equals murder is complete crap.		doc35
That's called discrimination based on level of dependency		doc36
It would seem to be the more compassionate thing to protect humans who are more dependent on others for their existence		doc36
You protect the weak		doc36
not exploit or kill them		doc36
I'm talking about human life		doc36
not personhood		doc36
Equivocating on terms is an attempt to ignore the obvious		doc36
were talking about human life		doc36
I don't know where you get your definition Oh I don't know		doc36
I just went to dictionary.com and got this definition and it doesn't discriminate on the basis of level of dependency like you do		doc36
What you call		doc36
potential		doc36
it calls life		doc36
In fact it makes no such distinction		doc36
Something is either alive or not		doc36
I couldn't find a definition for potential life		doc36
only an article referring to it as a		doc36
a clever rhetorical trick		doc36
And since the parents of this life are human It's safe to say it's human		doc36
That ought to be obvious to any casual observer		doc36
Here is the standard definition of life		doc36
the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms		doc36
being manifested by growth through metabolism		doc36
reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally		doc36
Banning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day		doc36
I hope your kidding because of course it would		doc36
That's why we ban things		doc36
to stop them		doc36
that would most certainly help all those innocent humans		doc36
by the standard definition of life, alive is now not alive		doc36
by the standard definition of life		doc36
So if something was alive we refer to it as dead		doc36
And that death came by willful intent		doc36
not an accident		doc36
In a court of law that's referred to as premeditated homicide		doc36
But since you can discriminate on the basis of level of dependency or level of development I guess that makes it OK		doc36
right		doc36
I don't think so		doc36
Call it what you will but a duck by any other name is still a duck.		doc36
No, ivelopment		doc37
Before it reaches a certain stage in development		doc37
it'd still only be a potential and it shouldn't have any rights whatsoever		doc37
I'm not ignoring anything		doc37
I'm trying to clarify things for		doc37
apparently, a stubborn fool		doc37
A human potential life before a certain stage in its development shouldn't be afforded any rights whatsoever		doc37
You're still dishing out BS and completely ignoring my points		doc37
potential		doc37
separately		doc37
then marry the 2 definitions together and then you should read this		doc37
I agree that it's life		doc37
I'm only making a distinction that it's potential		doc37
This is the case because even though it may have all the internal systems of a human life		doc37
they're in no condition to function until a certain stage is reached in its development		doc37
That's why it's a potential life		doc37
If you're incapable of putting the meanings of 2 separate words together, we should stop any further discussions		doc37
Don't quotemine my arguments for your benefit		doc37
I said we make laws to help us with our lives		doc37
Tell me how banning abortion helps with our lives		doc37
Don't deviate		doc37
You think the planet is overpopulated now		doc37
You think the Earth's resources are being stretched now		doc37
Just mandate the saving of every single pregnancies and you'll see how our lives will be affected then		doc37
Yes a duck is a duck		doc37
unless it's only a potential duck		doc37
People often try to personalize their pro-life argument by saying		doc38
imagine if YOUR mother had aborted YOU		doc38
YOU wouldn't be here!		doc38
to that I say I wouldn't have cared		doc38
I wouldn't have had the capacity to care		doc38
But people believe in reincarnation might say that I'd be somebody else		doc38
Another person		doc38
Probably still to the same mother		doc38
But if at the time		doc38
she really didn't want to have me		doc38
then I say it's her choice.		doc38
You wouldn't have cared		doc39
because you couldn't have cared		doc39
You would have never have had the chance to voice your opinion		doc39
to have your say as you do today.		doc39
So you agree with everything I just said		doc40
why then did you not click on the		doc40
support		doc40
link instead of the		doc40
Dispute		doc40
link?		doc40
Brilliant		doc41
Abortion is WRONG		doc41
and I don't know why some people can't get it through their thick skulls		doc41
Hmmm if you were a baby and were going to be born and you were aborted		doc41
you probably would care.		doc41
if you were a baby		doc42
were going to be born and were aborted		doc42
you probably would care		doc42
this statement is all about		doc42
if". In reality		doc42
the fetus has no mental capacity to care about anything		doc42
Before it could survive outside of the mother's womb		doc42
it should be entirely the mother's choice		doc42
not society's. I believe this is about 20 weeks into the pregnancy.		doc42
We wouldn't care		doc43
We couldn't. As a fetus the natural drive humans have for survival really isn't there		doc43
The mental capacity just wouldn't exist to care.		doc43
Technically speaking		doc44
a fetus is not a human yet		doc44
Having an abortion is similar to wearing a condom		doc44
No baby is made		doc44
yet intercourse still happens.		doc44
A fetus is a stage of development		doc45
The genes are what determines what kind of fetus it is		doc45
So when a human being has an abortion she takes the life of a human fetus		doc45
not the fetus of a dog or cat		doc45
a human fetus		doc45
About the condom		doc45
Using a condom is what you do before fertilization to try and prevent fertilization		doc45
An abortion is what you do after fertilization has occurred to stop further growth of the product of fertilization		doc45
And when done on humans it ends the life of a human in the early stages of development		doc45
Them are the facts		doc45
abortions on humans ends the life of a human		doc45
using condoms prevents the fertilization of the human sperm and egg.		doc45
If wearing a condom only prevents the fertilization of an egg, doesn't it also stop the fetus from being made		doc46
There isn't much difference in ending it and not letting it start.		doc46
No, you are simply mistaken		doc47
A fetus is a stage of development in the life span of an animal		doc47
We happen to be talking about the life of a human and nothing else.		doc47
Let me clarify my position		doc48
since I misstated it		doc48
The first question that needs to be asked is		doc48
 what kind of life is it?		doc48
If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate		doc48
Therefore no further questions are needed		doc48
I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual union		doc48
But isn't that just like human nature		doc48
everything is just fine until something conflicts with what we want and stands between us and what we desire		doc48
Then laws get broke		doc48
peace treaties ignored		doc48
property taken and people killed		doc48
But the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves		doc48
When we call evil		doc48
good		doc48
We may be guiltless before the law but that doesn't mean we are not without real quilt		doc48
But praise be to God that He has provided a solution to the two greatest problems man faces		doc48
guilt and death		doc48
With God there is forgiveness		doc48
but not without great cost.		doc48
FYI The question is not who did or didn't do this or that		doc49
The question is should abortion be banned		doc49
We already have laws against murder		doc49
it's just that Roe vs Wade made a loop hole in the law and that ought to scare the hell out of any sane individual		doc49
Because with that ruling a whole class of people just became non persons and no longer protected under the Constitution		doc49
Abortion is the unjustified taking of a human life in the early stages of development and that is wrong		doc49
And if it is within in your power to stop it and you don't		doc49
you are just as guilty		doc49
regardless of your political affiliation.		doc49
The defining characteristic of a person is sapience		doc50
You need thought		doc50
You need self awareness		doc50
And to get those things you need a functioning brain		doc50
Since there is no coherent brain activity in early fetal development until AT LEAST 22 weeks we are most certainly not dealing with anything we could meaingfully call a person prior to that time		doc50
And since something like 97% of all abortions occur in that window and any occuring after it are almost always for reasons of medical necessity that alone should end this discussion		doc50
2. EVEN IF we insisted on calling a fetus a person before then		doc50
Hell		doc50
even if we called it a person from the second it was conceived even though calling a few undifferentiated cells a		doc50
person		doc50
is insane		doc50
that still wouldn't be an arument for outlawing abortion since that requires declaring that the mother has no legal right to control over her own body		doc50
That it is superceded by another		doc50
person's		doc50
right to use her body for their own preservation		doc50
That is not a right that exists in our society		doc50
That right is possessed by NOBODY		doc50
and for good reason		doc50
I sure as hell cannot commandeer your body against your will to preseve my life		doc50
Nobody can walk up to you and force you to have surgery to give up a peice of your liver or some bone marrow because I need it to survive and my		doc50
right to life		doc50
trumps your right to have final say on what happens to your body		doc50
If we do that we define people as community property		doc50
Which is what outlawing abortion based on arguments that the mother doesnt have the right to say if her body gets used to carry a child to term would be doing		doc50
It's despicable		doc50
There is no justification fr outlawing abortion		doc50
Regulating it		doc50
Placing reaosnable restrictions on late-term occurances, yes		doc50
Outlawing		doc50
Absolutely not		doc50
It must be legal.		doc50
that thing inside you is not a virus		doc51
It has the potential to grow into an adult human which is very precious		doc51
and it has a heartbeat at 5 weeks		doc51
So there are millions of babies killed with a heartbeat every year		doc51
how sad 2. I don't want to control your body		doc51
Rather i want to protect the growing human inside of you.		doc51
When does life start		doc52
That is the question		doc52
This debate will be over in a matter of minutes if someone came up with the answer right now		doc52
Evangelists would believe it starts at contraception while scientists debate that it is more accurately the development of the brain which is the seventh week of development		doc52
Of course any right minded person wouldn't put the science of birth in the hands of someone with no scientific expertise so it is generally accepted that the 7th is the week that a clump of cells turn into human		doc52
However how can any scientist or evangelist understand when a child gains a soul as the question is purely philosophical		doc52
The soul has been deemed integral or essential to consciousness		doc52
personality and every free thinking person has a soul which defines his existence as a human being rather than an imamate object		doc52
Plato says that a soul is a combination of various aspects		doc52
Mind		doc52
reason		doc52
emotion, appetite and desire		doc52
These characteristics define a soul		doc52
According to Platoan philosophy		doc52
if you were void of one of these aspects you are without soul		doc52
-An unborn child has a mind which allows it to make functional processes in its body but is not capable of and thought		doc52
Thought encompasses things such as imagination		doc52
ideas and reflection		doc52
A lot of people say dreams are proof of an unborn child’s thought but dreams don’t count because they are instinctive of a human slumber		doc52
It forces the brain to stay asleep as an inactive brain causes your brain to disable processing information from nervous system and other systems		doc52
This could ultimately cause you to loose consciousness all together so an automatic reaction is to wake up		doc52
it’s like a screensaver		doc52
-An unborn child has no reason		doc52
it has no choices to create over itself		doc52
No study has shown that an unborn child has ever been able to conduct its own decisions rather than its own instinctive actions		doc52
-It has no emotion		doc52
no joy, sadness or pity		doc52
(For all your religious nuts out there, pain is not an emotion) -Appetite is only created through its instinct to survive		doc52
I suppose it counts		doc52
-Unborn children have no desire		doc52
They do not want anything but their instinct to		doc52
live, eat, and kick stomach every now and then		doc52
There is no aspiration or defining motive		doc52
If anyone has any counters against these points I would like to hear what you have to say		doc52
However I do believe this is an erudite explanation of the creation of ones consciousness from a philosophical standpoint		doc52
When an unborn child gains all these aspects it moves from inanimate object to living		doc52
breathing, free-thinking human being		doc52
Ty.		doc52
Life		doc53
please specify what you mean by the word		doc53
life". technically a fetus is indeed alive		doc53
a zygote is alive		doc53
Souls as supernatural things do not exist		doc53
or if you would prefer the less strong statement are not falsifiable or observable		doc53
Free will does not exist		doc53
it is non-sensical and thus to say a unborn child has never conducted its own decisions only instinctive actions is to say it has done only what any of us can do		doc53
Before conception		doc53
during it, after it etc Life never wasn't during a		doc53
successful pregnancy". 2 haploids of two different beings came together		doc53
forming a third being		doc53
keep in mind a being is distinct from person.		doc53
It's not a person		doc54
Abortion to me is no different than jizzing in a rag		doc54
sure there is potential that those cells could have made a person		doc54
but they aren't now and that they never will shouldn't bother anyone in the least		doc54
2. Given that there is 0 proof that the cluster of cells has any type of self-awareness, a preponderance of proof that the cluster of cells doesn't have self-awareness		doc54
then it is the case of a person doing something to their own body		doc54
People should be allowed to do whatever they like with there own body		doc54
3. Even if abortion were illegal, there is evidence that illegality has never stopped women from getting an abortion if they want one		doc54
Making it illegal would not save these imaginary people anyway		doc54
but it would kill scores of women who decide to get an abortion in a dirty basement instead of a clean hospital.		doc54
Who are any of you to decide what is right for a pregnant woman		doc55
When a woman has been raped and impregnated she doesn't deserve to have the choice		doc55
So in this wonderland were abortion is illegal 		doc55
is it that great		doc55
We would have children being born into homes where they are unwanted		doc55
women aborting themselves through god-awful ways, or adoption homes are flooded with unwanted children		doc55
Sound like a perfect world to you		doc55
It doesn't to me.		doc55
Abortion is not murder because a fetus is not a human		doc56
abortion is legal		doc56
What makes a fetus not a human?		doc57
What makes a human a human		doc58
What makes you think that your definition is accurate		doc58
A human can think		doc58
has some level of autonomy		doc58
and generally is able to survive on its own		doc58
Human is the biology		doc58
the culture, the history, shared by us all		doc58
A foetus in its early weeks cannot think		doc58
cannot take care of itself at all		doc58
can't make choices		doc58
Why would you impose upon women the inability to remove foetuses that aren't individuals?		doc58
It moves and has to be provided with nourishment and protection from the mothers womb		doc59
So it is not human		doc59
How is it not living		doc59
Thats like saying a fetus of a dog will not become a dog		doc59
Please explain		doc59
I really want to know your ideas		doc59
I think every woman and anyone that's for abortions		doc59
that has a voluntary abortion should have every reproduction organ removed from their body . My Aunt cannot have children and she wants one more than anything and some women are throwing them away like they were the fetus's are trash		doc59
Why won't they just have the baby and give it to someone like my aunt.		doc59
Do you realise that most abortions (over ninety percent) occur before the foetus even has brain tissue		doc60
Think about that for a moment		doc60
Everything that makes us what we are comes from our brain		doc60
but what's aborted in the vast majority of cases has NO brain		doc60
In many cases what's aborted is a microscopic bit of cells		doc60
This isn't the same as killing infants or babies		doc60
so you need to learn more about it and divorce yourself from that mindset.		doc60
its still taking nourishment from the mother		doc61
it still moves		doc61
I am a mom		doc61
do you know how i would feel now(after holding her) if i would've taken the alternative route		doc61
If its taking nourishment from its mother, it's not quite a human being yet		doc61
If it has a brain, that makes the issue more complex		doc61
Childbirth was a decision that you took		doc61
it worked for you		doc61
You need to understand that what works for doesn't work for many women.		doc61
Even if it doesn't have a brain, my belief is that the PERSON still has a soul		doc62
The soul is what gives the PERSON LIFE The bible says once you are conceived the chosen PERSON has a given soul that the Lord has chose for you		doc62
Please do not argue with my spiritual beliefs		doc62
i have chose to believe in God and the law protects that.		doc62
it is a human being		doc63
its not a human person		doc63
these concepts are distinct		doc63
I use the definition that it is human as an egg		doc64
zygote, and foetus until it is between 14 and 20 weeks old		doc64
At that point it is an open question whether it can be described as a person		doc64
or a human		doc64
Before then, it is tissue without a necessary nervous system.		doc64
That is why i am against the healthcare reform		doc65
My taxes WILL NOT pay for the MURDER of an unborn child		doc65
I refuse		doc65
Should not the philosophy behind laws and Laws themselves be consistent		doc66
If abortion is justified by the lack of sapience		doc66
Then could not the same argument be used to justify such things as dumpster babies		doc66
killing of severally mentally disabled people, people in a coma or any one who doesn't demonstrate sapience after birth		doc66
even during a temporary period like sleep		doc66
after all you will eventually demonstrate sapience when you wake up		doc66
which would be the same argument given stating that a fetus will eventually develop a brain and demonstrate sapience		doc66
well sleeping your moments are similar to the kicking a fetus may have		doc66
they are not a demonstration of sapience		doc66
The exact definition of sapience is interestingly not needed to show that a fetus doesn't have it		doc66
it simply needs to be shown that sapience requires a well enough developed brain and that a fetus lacks a developed enough one and thus lacks sapience no matter what is to be said of further defining of the concept of sapience		doc66
If the same criteria is applied towards organisms with developed brains then there are problems		doc66
Sapience is not always active		doc66
consciousness shuts down, comes in various degrees etc do these problems not amount to anything		doc66
If someone came to me and needed one of my organs		doc66
I would not be the cause of them needing my organ		doc66
I would not be liable for their situation		doc66
A mother in the majority of causes is liable for the situation		doc66
She is undeniably creating human life(which is indeed distinct from human person) only to destroy it		doc66
combine that with the complications above and this seem to be quite muddled		doc66
So the question seems to me to be more of weather our laws and philosophies behind them should be consistent and if they are not then it is not principles but rather utility they are based on		doc66
In such a case we should just say we allow abortion because it suits us		doc66
not that it is allowed because of some philosophical system or principled decision.		doc66
Abortion is not murder		doc67
I never forgot that		doc67
I was attacking the argument from sapience not debating weather it is ethical to deny the existence of a hypothetical being		doc67
your commentary isn't relative to what i posted		doc67
it is ethical to deny someone's or rather some human being's existence before they exist		doc67
It is ok to wear a condom		doc67
any such person being stopped from existing is just hypothetical		doc67
A fetus isnt a person		doc67
it is a human being		doc67
however just what the hell is a person		doc67
abortion gets down to questions that have been disputed for hundreds of years		doc67
and to this day don't possess satisfactory answers		doc67
A fetus is undeniably alive by the way		doc67
it just doesn't demonstrate sapience and can not		doc67
Expanding the scope of the argument leads to problems		doc67
showing that the argument from sapience is only valid with		doc67
"ifs		doc67
etc which would contradict the argument		doc67
Is a baby born less then one day ago really sapient		doc67
why not be able to put it in a dumpster		doc67
It does not have a choice of its own		doc67
person		doc67
Thus it fits the criteria and people should have the ability to kill it		doc67
for it is very dependent on a care taker(s) and what right does it have to impose on anyone		doc67
This is just one of many examples.		doc67
To be honest		doc68
murder,		doc68
but what is the other solution		doc68
The mother wants to abort because of some specific reason		doc68
let it be because the unborn child is deformed		doc68
it was a rape child		doc68
or it was just an unwanted child(by mistake when drunk and such)		doc68
Tell me honestly if you got an wanted child you would keep it because you think it is		doc68
murder". most people abort because they don't have the money to support that unborn child		doc68
Letting the child into a world of sh*t or spare it of what could have come		doc68
Why would you take the risk		doc68
Because if you do take the risk then and it turns out bad then it wouldn't only hurt the child's life		doc68
but yours too, and you families lives/economy		doc68
And in the long Run it will cost the country they live in a lot of money because if they can't provide someone has to get them money		doc68
Most likely that state and their family members		doc68
Also, the central nervous system begins functioning around week 4. Most abortions are performed around week 8. Think the fetus can't feel anything		doc69
This debate's URL is		doc70
abortion_30		doc70
indicates that it is the 30th debate to bear the title		doc70
Abortion". Next time		doc70
run a search and see how many like debates have already been made		doc70
Abortion violates the NAP in that it causes harm to another human		doc70
and so I cannot support it		doc70
I cannot comprehend how anybody can think that their own choice trumps the right to the life of another		doc70
I am alive		doc70
if another life is alive because of me		doc70
but can be terminated by me at a moment's notice		doc70
in what universe is it acceptable for me to put my own personal desires ahead of that of the other life		doc70
It is a different story if you choose to kill yourself		doc70
but to choose to kill somebody else		doc70
That's simply ludicrous to me.		doc70
Is an acorn a tree		doc71
Is an egg a chicken		doc71
The acorn has a chance to become a tree		doc71
Is a fetus a human		doc71
Science has blatantly proven this so many times that I truly question the opposing side's intellectual abilities		doc71
abortion is not murder		doc71
It's the termination of a collection of cells that cannot survive outside of the womb because it isn't a human		doc71
Can you feed a 4 week old fetus		doc71
Watch it cry		doc71
There are other ways the child can get taken care of.		doc72
Abortion is killing an innocent child		doc73
they dont even have a chance to live before they die		doc73
Their parents kill them before they have a chance at life.		doc73
Abortion may be murder		doc74
I personally don't care		doc74
I think abortion is an option that should always be kept open		doc74
I wouldn't want the burden of raising a child I can't raise		doc74
and I wouldn't want anyone to force me or anyone else to		doc74
And before someone tells me adoption is another option		doc74
I personally wouldn't like always wondering who is raising my child		doc74
and if they're raising them okay		doc74
I would rather a fetus is killed		doc75
then for a child to have a horrible life and get neglected by their parents.		doc75
But who is to say the child may not grow up to be the next Stephen Hawking		doc76
or even just a stable, healthy individual		doc76
Yes, there is also a chance that they would have a horrible life		doc76
But by killing the fetus		doc76
you remove ANY chance at all		doc76
It would be like the staff on the Titanic walking through the ship and killing every passenger aboard		doc76
rather than giving them a chance in the lifeboats or even in the open water (6 survived in the water by the way		doc76
Bet they were glad they were given the chance.)		doc76
I personally don't consider the fetus to be living		doc77
At least not in a way that matter		doc77
And it's considerably different to kill someone who already is living a life		doc77
than a fetus that simply has the possibility to live a life.		doc77
A women should be able to choose what happens with her body		doc78
especially concerning abortion and babies		doc78
Not because I support abortion		doc78
but what if you were the child of a mom		doc78
What if that mom only had you grudgingly because she was forced to have you		doc78
abortions being outlawed		doc78
Would you really want to grow up unloved		doc78
A child who's own mother would have aborted you		doc78
Worse than an accident		doc78
you are a person whom the people you are supposed to love		doc78
and are supposed to love you would rather have had you dead than given birth to you		doc78
In reality		doc78
it's not that bad, but forcing a mother to give birth to an unwanted child is cruel		doc78
and with the human population this high, with plenty of orphans already, why make more		doc78
Why go to the trouble and the pain for the mother		doc78
and the child, the entire family, and the whole world, when abortion could be an option		doc78
I support safe sex and planned pregnancy		doc78
I think abortion is murder		doc78
as is war or any human killing another human		doc78
but killing does happen		doc78
Every time you eat		doc78
you are eating something that was killed		doc78
plant or animal		doc78
If it reduces pain in the world, then you should be able to abort.		doc78
Seek the truth		doc79
not what you want the truth to be		doc79
That's why I'm not religious		doc79
Which religion		doc79
It's why I follow science and logic		doc79
to be logical is to reduce pain in the world		doc79
increase happiness, and gain knowledge, while being safe and helping people		doc79
That is why I must be pro-life AND pro-choice		doc79
I cannot force others to my opinion		doc79
just as others cannot force me, because it is only an opinion		doc79
I am against killing		doc79
but a fetus is a lot different than a fully grown human		doc79
or even a child		doc79
Anyways, I try to aim for objective truth in an objective world		doc79
so unless you believe in the supernatural		doc79
or things that can't be proven		doc79
my opinion, I've noted is almost always 100% correct		doc79
or consistent with my logic/morals		doc79
Happiness		doc79
freedom and knowledge are important to me		doc79
and on a debate forum, they should be to you too		doc79
Have a nice day		doc79
Does it not go against all reason that person A should have the right to kill person B		doc80
if person A finds person B's continued existence to be inconvenient		doc80
A woman may have a right to her body		doc80
but by choosing abortion she's affecting the rights of another persons body as well - the child's. And mental trauma from the abortion is no fitting punishment for murder		doc80
We don't let people freely walk away from unwillingly killing other people just because they feel bad about it.		doc80
This question has far greater implications		doc81
Are there such things as inalienable rights - human rights		doc81
The right to life for example		doc81
If there are, then there are two possibilites		doc81
1. Humans obtain their inalienable rights purely by being a human being		doc81
From the moment of conception		doc81
a distinct human being, with its own unique genetic signature, has been given rise - thus from the moment of conception a human being starts to exist and as such		doc81
with conception the inalienable rights are also given to the human merely for existing as a human being		doc81
2. We start bartering and haggling		doc81
When does a human get rights		doc81
what rights, which humans should get them etc etc		doc81
But if we conclude with this option		doc81
then there is no real reason to limit ourselves to the unborn - Nazi Germany is a very modern example of a nation haggling with these inalienable rights on born human beings		doc81
we need to see what implications rise from the views and ideas to which we have attached ourselves to		doc81
Now that you've thought about these implications		doc81
lets look at abortion from an honest perspective - it's the termination of the life of a developing human being for the sake of perserving the convenience and the satisfaction of another person		doc81
This is against all reason		doc81
Convenience does not justify the termination of another human's life - murder		doc81
The parents are generally always responsible for the creation of the fetus		doc81
so they should have the moral obligation to support the life of that fetus		doc81
If they do not want the child, they can give him/her up for adoption - adoption is not some myth		doc81
We must also strive for the creation of institutions that would take care of unwanted children in a loving		doc81
productive environment		doc81
Murder is not an acceptable alternative for a civilized nation		doc81
Given the fact that pregnancy lasts 9 months, one needs to ask themselves - Is murder justified by temporary inconvenience		doc81
For the sake of comparison		doc81
think of the USA, 1800 - the question of slavery		doc81
Some of you may object		doc81
but the general rethoric at the time was completely the same - Blacks are not fully human		doc81
thus they have no rights 		doc81
We should not force our opinions on other people		doc81
lets respect our freedom to choose 		doc81
We are not ready for such an extensive protection of human rights		doc81
we need to go step by step etc etc		doc81
Nowaydays we laugh and ridicule such arguments as we see it self-evidently that slavery is immoral and I'm convinced that 100 years from now		doc81
we'll be seeing abortion in the same light		doc81
As abortion does not affirm to my vision of what an ethical		doc81
civilized nation should be like - I'm forced to subscribe to the pro-life position.		doc81
What about adoption		doc82
If you don't want the child, give it up for adoption.		doc82
In all instances abortion is legal except extreme circumstance we know scientifically beyond doubt (despite christian blitz misinformation campaign on the subject) that the cluster of cells is not self-aware and is not capable of feeling pain		doc83
2. Nowhere in the U.S. is abortion legal after the 3rd trimester unless that cluster of cells is known to have birth defects which will kill it or the mother upon birth (again despite christian harassment and even murder of abortion doctors and their bullshit pictures of babies being sucked into a vacuum they make up and spread online like a disease). 3. No one is forcing anyone to have an abortion		doc83
If one side is not forcing one to abort, what gives another a right to force another not to abort		doc83
If you don't want an abortion don't have one, and if you think it's a sin let god handle it		doc83
he's like all powerful or something right		doc83
He doesn't need your help asshole		doc83
4. Making abortion illegal never in the history of the world has been shown to stop abortions from happening		doc83
5. Making abortions illegal has been shown to force rape victims and young girls		doc83
many of whom are practically babies themselves		doc83
to seek dangerous means for having an abortion		doc83
resulting in more deaths		doc83
Basically in their self-righteous single-minded inability to feel the least bit of empathy for actual living women		doc83
amidst their floating misconceptions of what a fetus is		doc83
pro-lifers would actually kill more		doc83
people		doc83
than save.		doc83
My fingernails and hair have human DNA as well		doc84
2. Inconsequential		doc84
3. It is well-established that it is not murder by the scientific community		doc84
It is only misguided feelings which insist it is murder		doc84
the purpose of laws is not to punish		doc84
That is a misconception		doc84
The purpose of law is to guarantee freedoms		doc84
rehabilitate, and remove dangerous individuals from society		doc84
5. You are stating the same boring points cited over		doc84
and over, and over by others on all of these debates		doc84
Your fingernails and hair do not make up the whole of you as a human		doc85
Without your hair or fingernails you would survive		doc85
On the contrary		doc85
abortion kills the entire individual organism		doc85
2. That whole issue is inconsequential		doc85
3. Science is silent on the issue of morality		doc85
However science does agree that the fetus has an individual genetic code and fits into the biological definition of life		doc85
It is an individual human by all biological standards		doc85
It is in no way a part of the mother		doc85
it just depends on the mother for survival (and so are children outside the womb). Because of this it is deserving of all human rights everyone else has		doc85
Unless you can show it is not an individual human or it is not alive		doc85
anything else is superfluous		doc85
4. You're just stating the positive side of the coin whereas I said the negative		doc85
5. You're refusing to answer the basic data over and over		doc85
Please share how a human fetus is not alive or how it is not an individual with a unique genetic code.		doc85
Just as my a human, so too a fetus does not make up the whole of a human		doc86
They do have equal feelings		doc86
emotions and understanding on the matter though		doc86
3. It is in every way part of the mother		doc86
It is a cluster of cells with no feelings		doc86
emotion of ability to be self-aware growing within her		doc86
And wether it is alive is not the point at all		doc86
It is not even close to the point		doc86
The point is whether it is self-aware and capable of feeling		doc86
without any doubt, is not		doc86
you're imagining a human where there is none		doc86
I'm giving you fact you're giving me your personal misguided feelings		doc86
5. My claim is not based on genetic code or whether it's living		doc86
It's based on being self-aware		doc86
Gentetic code and living have nothing to do with the matter as I clearly showed in the examples of hair		doc86
nails, insects and moss		doc86
I'll make you a deal		doc86
when you have the omniscient ability to know exactly what every female and fetus on earth is thinking and feeling and you can prove to me you have this ability		doc86
then if fetuses stop dying of natural causes all on their own magically		doc86
I'll agree with your self-righteous nosy bullshit.		doc86
At this point in the baby's life, it does		doc87
The fetus is an individual human		doc87
A fetus is just a term for a body in the womb of a mother		doc87
2. It is a collection of human cells with a different genetic code than the mother		doc87
It is alive and an individual		doc87
Again there are people born who are never self-aware		doc87
some who never feel		doc87
so on your view are they not people		doc87
The fetus may be dependent on the mother for survival		doc87
but so is a newborn		doc87
so is an infant		doc87
and so is a child		doc87
These are all different stages of development of an individual human being		doc87
It's not like the fetus is an organ of the mother - it is an individual human life		doc87
3. By all biological definitions it's an individual humans		doc87
I could say you're giving me your own personal misguided feelings		doc87
Let's stick with medical facts		doc87
4. Again hair and nails are not individual humans - they're part of you		doc87
In the case of abortion it is killing the entire organism		doc87
akin to poisoning you to death		doc87
Not your nails or hair		doc87
but your entire self		doc87
If self-awareness is the test of personhood, again that advocates the killing of the retarded		doc87
comatose, and senile elderly		doc87
Moss and insects are a red herring		doc87
You're getting too emotional with the argument		doc87
I don't have to be omniscient to know that it is wrong to murder innocent human beings because they inconvenience you		doc87
The fetus is a separate human life and deserves protection if any human deserves protection		doc87
Also you don't make a distinction between killing something and that thing dying of natural causes		doc87
This is retarded		doc88
It's not a sentient being		doc88
It is the woman's body		doc88
It is none of your business what another does with their body		doc88
You want to justify forcing your morality on others		doc88
and are reaching for quazi-logic to do it		doc88
There is no logic in it though		doc88
Only religious superstition		doc88
One of the reasons your religion is so evil and dangerous when weilded by most of you		doc88
you cannot even see your own totalitarian views on morality should you be given enough power in any situation to control others		doc88
and you will literally make-up bullshit like your argument to justify it		doc88
"It's alive		doc88
- yeah I know		doc88
but not sentient		doc88
"Human DNA		doc88
- yeah		doc88
I know but not sentient		doc88
"Your changing the argument		doc88
- still not sentient		doc88
Stick to the facts		doc88
- nope		doc88
still not sentient		doc88
It's silly		doc88
If god doesn't like it let him come tell people otherwise		doc88
Until then tell your fellow christians to stop with the abortion doctor death threats and scaring girls on their way to clinics		doc88
Also you don't make a distinction between killing something and that thing dying of natural causes		doc88
lmao		doc88
If god is all powerful he's killing more fetuses than every abortion doctor combined.		doc88
It's not a sentient being		doc89
I never disputed this		doc89
I asked if		doc89
on your view, the retarded, senile, and comatose are all in the same boat as fetuses as none of them are self-aware and some are not feeling		doc89
It is the woman's body		doc89
It's a separate human life form inside the woman's body		doc89
but it in no way is a part of her body		doc89
In the same way a splinter is in my body but not a part of my body		doc89
The fetus is not an organ of the mother		doc89
It is none of your business what another does with their body		doc89
It is in the case of depriving someone else of their rights		doc89
like murder		doc89
Only religious superstition		doc89
I haven't once made a religious statement here		doc89
I've only given statements from biology		doc89
One of the reasons your religion is so evil and dangerous when weilded by most of you		doc89
you cannot even see your own totalitarian views on morality should you be given enough power in any situation to control others		doc89
and you will literally make-up bullshit like your argument to justify it		doc89
Cool red herring and ad hominem		doc89
If god doesn't like it let him come tell people otherwise		doc89
Until then tell your fellow christians to stop with the abortion doctor death threats and scaring girls on their way to clinics		doc89
Only if you actually answer the one question I've asked and stick with biology instead of emotion		doc89
If god is all powerful he's killing more fetuses than every abortion doctor combined		doc89
You really enjoy ruddy fish		doc89
So can I get an answer to my question up top now?		doc89
We are all just a cluster of cells		doc90
There are some people who are never self-aware due to mental diseases		doc90
There are some people who don't feel pain because of neurological disorders		doc90
This hardly disqualifies them from humanity		doc90
Of course it doesn't disqualify them from being considered human		doc90
But it does mean that they are not persons		doc90
i.e. they do not possess the essential characteristics of personhood		doc90
which are rationality		doc90
autonomy and self-consciousness		doc90
2. I agree that in life-or-death situations		doc90
the doctors have to make a call to save the mother or the baby		doc90
This is atypical		doc90
however, and only happens in about 2-3% of all cases		doc90
But you haven't stated whether abortion		doc90
in such unfortunate circumstances, are right or wrong		doc90
3. The issue is not whether or not people are forced to have abortions		doc90
The issue is whether or not abortion is murder		doc90
If abortion is murder, then we have a problem		doc90
We should not think the legalization of murder is ok just because no one is forcing us to murder others		doc90
On the contrary		doc90
this is an issue of whether you would consider abortion as murder or not		doc90
you yourself seem to think that this issue is paramount to the debate since you went on to talk about the legalisation of murder and used that as an analogy		doc90
4. This applies to murder		doc90
rape, theft, and every other crime		doc90
Of course it won't stop some people from doing it		doc90
but it will allow for law enforcement to punish for committing crimes		doc90
It will also help to educate youth on what is morally acceptable and what is morally horrid		doc90
My question to you is		doc90
is abortion morally acceptable		doc90
5. This issue is moot if a fetus is an individual human life		doc90
We shouldn't legalize murder to make it less hazardous to the murderer		doc90
Besides this rape is never the fault of the baby		doc90
so how does anyone have a right to kill it		doc90
You seem to forget that rape is also never the fault of the victim . With this being true		doc90
how can you deny the victim/mother-to-be the right to make choices concerning her own body if it is not her fault in the first place?		doc90
So on your view, then, it would be ok to kill these humans because they are not people		doc91
The short answer is		doc91
but the long answer would have to be		doc91
no". What about babies outside of the womb who are newborn		doc91
They lack rationality		doc91
autonomy, and self-consciousness		doc91
No, they don't. According to the OED		doc91
autonomy is defined as		doc91
a. The condition of being controlled only by its own laws		doc91
and not subject to any higher one		doc91
b. Organic independence.		doc91
A baby that is born do have autonomy		doc91
Self-consciousness is defined		doc91
according to the OED		doc91
Consciousness of one's own identity, one's acts, thoughts, etc.		doc91
As long as one has knowledge of what one is doing		doc91
he/she is said to possess self-consciousness		doc91
A baby that is born can said to have self-consciousness		doc91
2. I think it's morally neutral in these cases		doc91
If between a rock and a hard place, where the doctor has to make a life-or-death call		doc91
it would be morally permissible (not good or evil) to do so		doc91
a rock and a hard place		doc91
is not the same as moral neutrality		doc91
morally permissible is not morally neutral		doc91
You are contradicting yourself here		doc91
3. I think you misread it because your response agrees with me		doc91
The issue is whether or not abortion is murder		doc91
Legality and morality are separate		doc91
of course, but legality should flow out of morality		doc91
it seems like I have misread your statement		doc91
I apologise for that		doc91
And I agree with what you have said about legality and morality		doc91
except in life-or-death cases as stated above		doc91
you haven't provided any good arguments to exclude all the other cases from being morally permissible		doc91
5. But neither is it the fault of the child		doc91
It's unfortunate		doc91
but the mother being wronged in no way makes it morally acceptable for her to thereby wrong the baby		doc91
the fetus is neither a		doc91
child		doc91
baby". Thus		doc91
your entire argument is moot		doc91
while I agree that the injustice accrued to someone is not justification for that person to wrong any one else		doc91
you are assuming that the fetus has the same rights as the mother		doc91
since the fetus is not a person		doc91
it would be fallacious to accrue the same rights to a fetus as you would any other person.		doc91
Give me a few more years and I suspect I'll be 99% pro-life as my opinion continues to evolve the older I get		doc92
At this point I believe it should be rare		doc92
only in the first trimester and only once		doc92
not to be used as a form of birth control		doc92
As for rape and incest		doc92
I don't know if I will ever believe that abortion shouldn't be allowed in those cases.		doc92
I am prochoice when the mother's life is in danger and the baby is to young to survive.		doc93
It's funny how people have abortions just because they can't be responsible enough to use protection		doc94
If the person was raped or could die from the pregnancy, I can understand		doc94
But honestly		doc94
people should never get an abortion if they are just too irresponsible		doc94
Makes me sick		doc94
As a woman who does not hold a religious stance on this but rather a personal experience stance		doc95
I think my argument holds a lot of water		doc95
I had an abortion		doc95
I regret it deeply		doc95
I am older now and realize how selfish of a decision it was		doc95
I think because we can't see or hold or converse with the life		doc95
it is easy to dismiss but		doc95
3 years later		doc95
I had two children already and had been basically tricked into a pregnancy I did not want		doc95
My boys were older		doc95
I had my life together and did not want another child		doc95
The issue was pushed by my partner and I was given an ultimatum		doc95
I got pregnant and he left 8 weeks into it		doc95
I was backed against a wall		doc95
scared, confused		doc95
How would I care for 3 children alone		doc95
I made an appointment and drove to Las Vegas ( hours and hours from where I lived		doc95
) Once there I broke down in the parking lot and drove all the way home		doc95
I went through with the pregnancy and gave birth to a gorgeous little girl		doc95
met a guy that has been her dad for the last 5 years and I am reminded everytime I look at her		doc95
that the only thing that separated her from death was my unwillingness to walk up a flight of stairs		doc95
She almost wasn't here		doc95
so close		doc95
She also reminds me of the who isn't here because of a selfish decision I made		doc95
I like how so many people forget about adoption as an option		doc95
Denying life a chance		doc95
Life is defined scientifically as any organism containing most or all of the following qualities		doc96
1. Homeostasis - regulation of internal environment 2. Organization - composed of one or more structured cells 3. Metabolism - able to transform food into energy and use it 4. Growth - increasing in size or complexity 5. Adaptation - ability to change over time in response to environment 6. Response to stimuli - reacting to outside objects (recoiling when poked		doc96
etc) 7. Reproduction - ability to produce more organisms From the moment of conception		doc96
the new cell has all of these attributes		doc96
It fits into the definition of life		doc96
The new cell also has a unique genetic code not found in the mother		doc96
given the definition of life and the fact that the new life has a differing genetic code from its mother we can conclude that it is a separate human being in early stages of development		doc96
As a separate human being it has the same worth and rights as any other human being		doc96
If this is true no other arguments matter		doc96
Size		doc96
stage of growth (children are less developed than adults		doc96
are they less than human?)		doc96
and location do not matter at all		doc96
If it is an individual human being, it has all the rights and protections of all other human beings		doc96
Killing this life is tantamount to murder.		doc96
This is not always the case		doc97
There are some forms of retardation in which they never achieve these		doc97
I personally know of one little girl who has massive brain damage and will never be able to fit your description		doc97
People in comatose (if we follow your definition of personhood) lose their personhood upon going comatose - they cannot gain knowledge		doc97
exercise wisdom, love others, find purpose		doc97
or integrate into society		doc97
Now the incredible irony of all of this is that the fetus can do all of these things given the chance		doc97
If on your view these people are persons because they have the potential of doing these things, how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things		doc97
Reproduction		doc97
in the sense of simple life just means the ability to replicate oneself in some manner		doc97
It's not sexual reproduction		doc97
no, but that's not what the definition refers to		doc97
Otherwise single-celled organisms which reproduce asexually wouldn't be considered alive		doc97
Clarification		doc97
I am against abortion in all but life-or-death cases		doc97
At that point I think the doctor needs to make the call and save either the mother or the baby		doc97
The moral landscape is such at that point that it's permissible to take action one way or the other because the doctor is sworn to do everything he can to keep his patient alive.		doc97
Hello abortion debate number 9374638382943739393		doc98
I've said this all too many times		doc98
fetus is not conscious		doc98
no different to killing an ant		doc98
own personal choice, blah blah blah		doc98
Read one of the other billion abortion debates for my opinion.		doc98
I am for abortion but not if it is late-term		doc99
the things I feel that must be allowed is abortion after rape		doc99
abortion if the woman is not going to take care of her child		doc99
abortion if the woman's life is in danger		doc99
abortion if the baby is going to be disabled(if they wish) .		doc99
A fetus is NOT a human		doc100
just a mass﻿ of tissue Abortion is safer than childbirth The number of abortions are relatively small Nobody has the right to impose their morals on others A woman should be able to control her own body Abortion must be kept legal		doc100
especially for all the rape and incest pregnancies If abortion is outlawed women will be forced to go to back-alley abortion clinics Aborting an unwanted fetus reduces the number of abused children		doc100
By that definition, so you are you		doc101
So am I. Abortion is safer than childbirth HA		doc101
In the same way that murder is safer than living		doc101
The number of abortions are relatively small The number of murders are relatively small		doc101
Should we no legalize murder		doc101
rape, and theft		doc101
Then why do we have laws against murder		doc101
child rape		doc101
torture		doc101
assault		doc101
grand larceny		doc101
To say that a fetus is merely an extension of its parent needs some substantiation		doc101
Fair enough		doc101
Should this have a bearing on its endorsement as legal by the state		doc101
HA		doc101
In the same way that mass genocide prevents accidental deaths.		doc101
your heart is a mass of tissue so why dont you suck that out and chuck it in the bin		doc102
All is fair in love and war		doc103
There is no need to be so sarcastic and rude for such a serious debate		doc103
So stop being a troll		doc103
pull your head out of your pants and think straight		doc103
ABORTION = MINIATURE GENOCIDE.		doc103
A fetus is NOT a human		doc104
just a mass﻿ of tissue No, we have a mind No		doc104
it's less dangerous to abort than give birth		doc104
wth^^ Fair enough Those are not morals		doc104
morals are more of opinions		doc104
these are really not opinions A fetus is like a parasite		doc104
should a mother have no choice		doc104
it could cause a lot of crime		doc104
which the state doesn't want, and it would be more dangerous HA		doc104
I suppose		doc104
No, we have a mind Define mind		doc105
If by mind you mean sentience, fetuses are sentient after 12 weeks		doc105
in the same way that mass genocide reduces the number of traffic accidents		doc105
I don't understand your argument		doc105
She had a choice		doc105
She CHOSE to have sex		doc105
knowing full well the possible ramifications of such an action		doc105
Of course criminalizing an act will increase the criminal offenses of that act		doc105
But that is not an argument in and of itself.		doc105
That is a wonderful answer and I 100% agree		doc106
Even though they are not technically		doc106
alive		doc106
it is still killing a baby		doc106
All those masses of babies killed is like premature genocide and should be illegal by mind		doc106
spirit and by law.		doc106
The number of abortions are relatively small Sorry		doc107
I just wanted to clarify		doc107
(I'm very pro-choice). this like it's a positive thing that the number of abortions had is relatively small		doc107
prior to that Why would you want less abortions if the doctor is simply aborting tissue?		doc107
Abortion is a way to prevent more poor families		doc108
suffering children		doc108
and used as back up when birth control fails		doc108
I don't think anyone who used protection in sex should be saddled with a child		doc108
A child is a lot of work		doc108
and if you don't want the child then you both suffer for the next eighteen years.		doc108
If you were even considering abortion, why would you even want to have sex and get pregnant in the first place if there is a possibility of conceiving and getting pregnant		doc109
Makes no sense		doc109
It's just illogical and stupid		doc109
DUH		doc109
Um, have you ever had sex		doc110
lol It's kind of fun		doc110
Not too mention it's great for relationships		doc110
Sex isn't just for reproducing anymore		doc110
We've made it where we can have sex for pleasure		doc110
It's narrow-minded to just think of sex just as reproducing		doc110
It's also no fun if you think of it just like that.		doc110
thing		doc111
inside of a women stomach (cuz we all know that's where the come from) is not a true human being until it comes out into the world		doc111
Therefore science should have the ability to complete the task		doc111
There is no moral issue here		doc111
The problem I and most of you should have is the stupid teenagers who have sex think they have an easy way out		doc111
They should have to pay the consequences for their actions		doc111
I am still for abortion but there is one big problem I have with it.		doc111
abortion should be a womans choice		doc112
once a certain time period has passed threw the pregnacny then it should not occur		doc112
but why bring a child into the world that someone does not want		doc112
just for it to be put in an adoption home to spend the rest of its life knowing that mommmy and daddy didnt want them		doc112
in my opinion its way better to prevent the suffering & over population.		doc112
I'm confused		doc113
Why would you want it to occur more frequently?????		doc113
People don't really choose to abort a child		doc113
they resort to it.		doc113
I am against abortion because it is practically kill the baby inside the womb		doc114
And that is a innocent child in the womb if you decide to abort the child you are basically committing murder and destroying a innocent life.		doc114
Abortion is wrong sure there are instances that people think that it is right but it never is you are taking a life away even if the baby is not alive yet you take away that oppertunity away if you say for instance get raped or the condom breaks give the baby up for adoption but still be apart of its life I have noticed that the people that say abortion is right are alive and their parents didnt go through an abortion		doc115
First of all, do you know what a comma or period is		doc116
Because your whole argument is just one huge sentence		doc116
Break it up		doc116
It's not right even if the mother will die during childbirth		doc116
Or if it is a fact that the child will be born with a disorder that will make it suffer all it's life and die in only about ten years after birth		doc116
It's still wrong then		doc116
Some people are against adoption in the same way you are against abortion		doc116
They simply can't go through with it		doc116
And you can't always be apart of it's life once you put it up for adoption		doc116
nor do some people want to		doc116
This is the stupidest argument ever		doc116
if any parent did then it would irrelevant		doc116
on many occasions, which my mother had had another abortion when I was conceived		doc116
She suffered greatly by deciding to keep me and my twin brother		doc116
and I wish she had simply aborted us and lived a better life for herself.		doc116
I believe that abortion cannot be justified because it is killing an innocent human being		doc117
Every child is a precious and unique gift from God		doc117
We have no right to destroy this		doc117
United Nations declaration says children have a right to protected before as well as after birth		doc117
And if it is not possible for your to have a baby		doc117
due to shortage of money or time		doc117
Nowadays many couples would adopt unwanted babies.		doc117
From the time of conception, a child is alive and to abort a child is killing the child		doc118
and if you are aborting because of medical reasons		doc118
you should let the child die naturally inside the mother		doc118
the dead child will then be absorbed by the mothers body.		doc118
Abortion is not advised as it dangers the new life of new humans living on Earth.		doc119
There are already too many humans living on Earth		doc120
We don't need more.		doc120
It's the girl's fault for not taking birth controls		doc121
having the guy use a condom		doc121
or using any other type of protection when having sex		doc121
I know that women have their own rights		doc121
but if they didn't use any kind of protection		doc121
and are underage		doc121
then it's their fault and responsibility		doc121
I only agree to abortion if the women was raped and then became pregnant		doc121
well, heres what i think		doc122
its ok to abort an unborn child because it is the parents decision to do so		doc122
once the baby is actually a living creature in your stomach besides just the fetus		doc122
it maybe then could be considered illegal since you are killing a baby		doc122
not a fetus		doc122
so say the fetus develops into an actuall baby at		doc122
i dont know 6 months		doc122
am i right		doc122
wrong		doc122
but when its an actuall baby and then you abort, then it may be considered murder		doc122
all right i'll just break it down abortion of a fetus:legal abortion of a baby		doc122
possibly wrong		doc122
Abortion should be legal as it is the mother's decision to kill said baby		doc123
yet in saying that they should have sufficient help to make this decision		doc123
i believe that abortion should be legal because all an abortion is		doc124
is preventing a baby from being born into the world		doc124
if thats the case		doc124
then what are we doing by using birth control or condoms		doc124
we are preventing a baby from being born into the world		doc124
its also the mother's choice		doc124
and the father if hes still around		doc124
and what about those who are raped and unfortunate with a baby of that specific person.		doc124
this is true		doc125
but there is also the fact that why should a baby that nobody wanted be born		doc125
when the parents dont want them to be around		doc125
what if it was a mistake		doc125
so many emo's are in the world because they couldnt be aborted all in all		doc125
abortion should be legal		doc125
Should abortion be legal		doc126
It was like asking should murdering another person should be legal		doc126
I can't see the point why it should be legal in any sense		doc126
Abortion = murder		doc126
Because you are planning to take the life of another human		doc126
Don't tell me that fetuses are not babies because in every single way they are		doc126
And if they are human they have all the right to live		doc126
You can have them be adopted if you are not ready with the child		doc126
Just don't take their first right away from them.		doc126
Abortion should be illegal.Because it not fair to those babies that are being killed for the fault of those adult and I think that that everybody deserve chance to life .		doc127
Abortion should be consider illegal		doc128
it is not the unborn child's fault that they was to be given life		doc128
the ones who conceded the child are at fault		doc128
even if the child is unborn the child should still have every other right to live as any other human being for the child is a human being too		doc128
and it would be murder and disgrace to kill a child that has yet to be born and to kill a innocent child who has convicted no crime unless you call being alive and wanting to live a crime		doc128
then in that case everyone in the human race has committed a crime.		doc128
Fuck No, how can you possibly think that it's the women's right to choose		doc129
the fetus is a living being that is growing and was created by God what right do you have to destroy what he has made good		doc129
You just should not have had sex in the first place why don't you be a little more responsible next time you go out and act like giant whore you stupid bitch		doc129
What the hell is your problem it's a human life		doc129
it's your own child for gods sake da hell		doc129
May god have mercy on your soul because I sure as hell wouldn't just consider your self lucky that there is a god that is more forgiving then I am.		doc129
It really is the mother's decision		doc130
If she isn't wanting to take care of it who will		doc130
Yes the father maybe		doc130
but what if your raped		doc130
what if you didnt want the baby and the husband altered the birthcontrol pills into something else		doc130
Yes you could put it into an adoption agency		doc130
but what if they grow up wonderign why there parents gave them up		doc130
They would feel like crap thinking that there parents hated them		doc130
and be suicidel		doc130
No one deserves the live of bouncing around in foster homes		doc130
thinking no one loves them		doc130
They may get into a caring family but do you know how many kids get into crappy situations		doc130
It is the persons decisions		doc130
we souldnt have a law saying this is a bad thing to do		doc130
Its a moral and a value we all have and we all have different views		doc130
why should we care about what other people do with there lives		doc130
especally people we dont even know.		doc130
im sorry but i would much rather have my baby in heaven then on earth if i couldn't take care of it		doc131
i don't understand why we feel that we get to dictate what other people can do with their bodies		doc131
different people have different morals and we can't tell them what to think or feel		doc131
it's not right to tell people what to think or feel then they aren't who they are anymore.		doc131
Most adopted children do not become suicidal		doc132
they might wonder about their biological parents but i wouldnt say they think that they hated them		doc132
giving up your child for adoption is an act of love rather than hate		doc132
Why should you kill a innocent baby		doc133
That is exactly what abortion is		doc133
Even though the mother does not want the baby, she should still have it		doc133
Most of the people who want an abortion and never go through with it		doc133
actually say they would regret killing the baby		doc133
Should America become		doc133
When a fetus hasnt been born yet it isnt a person to me		doc134
If somethign cannot live without something for it to hook up to for life support it isnt alive		doc134
It isnt alive until it is born		doc134
It could be way more hazardous to the mother than the child.		doc134
It's about freedom - a woman's freedom to control her own body		doc135
and a couple's freedom to decide when is a good time to bring a child into the world.		doc135
Simply to play devil's advocate		doc136
"its about freedom-a woman's freedom to control her own body". However		doc136
once she becomes pregnant		doc136
is it only her body then		doc136
Her body is supporting another life so one can make the argument that she is then sharing her body with another being and it is no longer her own.		doc136
Imagine this scenario		doc137
A woman is walking to her house		doc137
all of a sudden a man grabs her from an alley		doc137
He rapes her		doc137
Should the woman be forced to have the baby of the man who raped her		doc137
Even if the baby was put up for adoption, the woman would go through all the pain of having a baby		doc137
and the medical fees, and the baby might not be adopted.		doc137
your stupid		doc138
obviously a person can choose what they want to do it should be up to the mother or father to decide what they would like to do with their unborn child		doc138
No it isn't stupid		doc139
A person shouldn't be allowed to kill a future child		doc139
They are willing enough to create the child and I believe that they need to own up to their own responsibilities		doc139
It was their choice to tango and they need to pay up for it		doc139
God wanted the child there for a reason		doc139
There is always adoption as an option!		doc139
Even if a zygote or early term fetus was a person (which it isn't)		doc140
And even if that person had all the rights that other people have (which it doesn't)		doc140
I sure as hell don't have the right to commandeer someone else's body against their will for nine months to keep myself alive and neither does a fetus		doc140
The only way to argue that a woman doesn't have the right to terminate a pregnancy she doesn't want is to declare her body to be a piece of property that she doesn't have the right to final say over the use of		doc140
And it's just that simple.		doc140
At what point do you believe the zygote becomes a		doc141
person"		doc141
are you meaning to say that the fetus purposefully		doc141
commandeered		doc141
the mother's body		doc141
I don't believe the baby had a choice which body it wanted to inhabit.		doc141
The easy answer is when it is born		doc142
The more complicated answer is when it has developed its brain.		doc142
yeah so people have the right to decide		doc143
certain things happen in life and some people may not be able to support a baby		doc143
if a girl gets raped and becomes pregnant does she really want to carry that man's child		doc143
i wouldn't. plus some women have serious conditions so if they do carry a child to term they could die in labor		doc143
this is not good and they should have an abortion to save their life		doc143
it's simply not our choice to decide what people want to do with their bodies and if they feel it is not killing someone then it is not on our plates it is on theirs.		doc143
if she cant care for it there are plenty or people out there who want a child of thier own and cannot have one you can always give the child up for adoption		doc144
adoption is a piece of shit institution		doc145
all the kids who would have been aborted get put up for adoption		doc145
thousands of more kids getting shuffled around in foster care		doc145
oh boy		doc145
and by the way, god isn't real.		doc145
adoption is not a piece of shit		doc146
i sure as hell would rather have my kid (if i had to give them up) go to someone who has had background checks and various other things before they can adopt		doc146
Foster homes aren't even with adoption		doc146
those are totaly different things and are bad but not related.		doc146
So, are you suggesting that if woman became pregnant accidentally		doc147
she should go through with that pregnancy just to hand it over to someone else		doc147
Isn't that a bit dangerous for both of them?		doc147
babies that are adopted are given to families who want to raise them		doc148
not to just put up with them for a few months so they wouldnt be		doc148
shuffled around in foster care		doc148
they would be in permanent homes so your argument is invaild		doc148
Not true		doc149
There are more unwanted children than families willing to adopt (123,000 more as of 2008). If abortion were illegal, that number would balloon		doc149
stats_research/afcars/trends.htm		doc149
exactly why we can't make abortions illegal		doc150
if a parent is unwilling to take care of the child they are about to have then they should not have had the child in the first place		doc150
since they've already had the child		doc150
why should they bring it into the world if it is only going to suffer?		doc150
A baby is a life		doc151
no one has the right to decide who lives and who dies		doc151
the parents should have been more careful if they didnt want a child		doc151
young mothers		doc152
should have kept their legs shut if they didn't want a baby.		doc152
While abortion may not be considered as murder or manslaughter, one thing is for sure		doc153
By going ahead with an abortion		doc153
you are denying someone		doc153
or atleast something life		doc153
Life is the most sacred		doc153
fundamental right of a human being		doc153
While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being		doc153
you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person		doc153
Had the fetus not been terminated		doc153
it could've had so much potential		doc153
It would grow up to be a child		doc153
It would get to listen to music		doc153
smell the first day of spring and catch the first glimpse of snow		doc153
Everything we take for granted in life and life itself		doc153
is taken from the fetus		doc153
Many argue that an unborn child does not have consciousness and therefore		doc153
it is morally acceptable to undergo an abortion		doc153
In the same sense		doc153
is it alright to inject lethal toxin into a child that has been sedated for his whole life		doc153
Pro-choice people are therefore saying that we can deny life to something that has never experienced consciousness		doc153
This argument is irrational and morally incorrect		doc153
What's more worrying is that the mother of a fetus makes this decision		doc153
The very provider of life and sustenance refuses to let her unborn child live		doc153
It is not her choice to make		doc153
It is no one's choice to make		doc153
No one should have the authority to deny an unborn child life		doc153
Imagine the world without you		doc153
because your mother had an abortion		doc153
You would never live all of your experiences		doc153
You would never have emotions		doc153
You would've never existed		doc153
Such is the travesty of abortion		doc153
Over a million lives		doc153
of which collectively would add up to over 70 million years		doc153
would never be lived		doc153
Rape		doc153
sadly does happen		doc153
But legalizing abortion does not solve the problem		doc153
If we want to reduce the amount of unwanted pregnancies as a result of rape, then we need to tackle the issue of rape itself		doc153
Harsher penalities		doc153
stricter monitoring policies		doc153
promoting rape whistles		doc153
reducing poverty and a nationwide sex offender registry are all possible solutions for this		doc153
Reducing the amount of unwanted pregnancies from rape down to zero is next to impossible		doc153
but we can get this number a lot lower		doc153
Unwanted adult and teenage pregnancies can be solved by removing the social stigma associated with contraceptives		doc153
Pharmacies and the government should advocate the use of condoms or birth control pills as a way to enjoy sex without any unwanted consequences		doc153
Abortion means denying the opportunity of life to what would've been a someone		doc153
We cannot continue with this madness.		doc153
Yea, christians aren't perfect		doc154
If you were responsible you would have done the right thing in the first place, but obviously if you are in the abortion state		doc154
you weren't responsible		doc154
If you aren't prepared for what might happen due to your own actions, then don't do it		doc154
If you don't risk mistakes then you wouldn't be put into the situation.		doc154
This is where we have a fundamental disagreement		doc155
I see the zygote as human life		doc155
Not a cell that is part of a mammal		doc155
The zygote		doc155
if allowed to continue growing naturally		doc155
will become a human being		doc155
to terminate this human life is murder.		doc155
This is rather dangerous thinking		doc155
Whether a the fetus is self-aware or not does not prove or disprove it's humanity		doc155
I take it you are gun-ho on euthanasia		doc155
possibly even as radical as Peter Singer on these issues.		doc155
What you fail to realize is that I am not concerned with the legality of this concept of life		doc155
this is a profound moral issue		doc155
You keep harping the point that life begins at the stage of self-awareness		doc155
This is very comical because technically we don't know when that is yet		doc155
So to base your argument for the beginning of life on an assumption makes for a very weak point.		doc155
The zygote that results from intercourse naturally will form into a fetus		doc155
Dander will not naturally form into a fetus		doc155
unless one goes through means of the things that you've just described		doc155
man-made		doc155
unnatural means		doc155
That's the difference.		doc155
Sure, up until the point where there is another human life inside that body		doc155
There are now two humans rather than one		doc155
What about the right of the human inside the woman		doc155
You seem to ignore that human's rights.		doc155
And the woman who has an abortion essentially agrees to assist a doctor in murdering her child by sucking it's brains out		doc155
of course, is for her own selfish		doc155
arrogant, and unethical agenda.		doc155
When you find a human being that came from a single sperm alone		doc155
what you just typed is ridiculous		doc155
No one would possibly even argue that under any circumstances (except you of course).		doc155
Abortion should definitely banned except when the mothers life may be at risk		doc156
In any other situation		doc156
there are plenty of other options such as adoption.		doc156
in my opinion it should be because if you don't want to get pregnant why are you having sexual activity		doc157
Because sexual activity is awesome and a sign of good health		doc158
It is a primal action that is at the foundation of humans' hierarchy of needs (according to Maslow		doc158
wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ 800px-maslows_hierarchy_of_needssvg.png) ) So stopping sex is not the solution to the abortion debate		doc158
People do need to be careful and do need to be held accountable for their actions		doc158
but accidents happen and shouldn't people be able to have a choice in how to deal with such a life-altering event?		doc158
What if the woman in question was a victim of rape or incest		doc159
what about rape?		doc160
should that poor girl go through her life looking at the child of a rapist?		doc160
thats what the other debater said		doc161
unless it was an accident or her life was in dangerr		doc161
ok and like i saidd		doc162
every mothere should have her own desicon on whether or not they want to go through a pregancy		doc162
For instance what if it wasnt a accident to have the child and the mother found out that her soon to be baby was special ed		doc162
so she desided to get an abortion		doc162
I know she's killin a life and i do think thats wrong		doc162
but in the same way she might want to protect that unborn from going through pain and trials in the future		doc162
Let me remind you that the title of this argument		doc162
 Abortion should be Banned". Thats a straight forward yes or no question and since there are		doc162
(what if it is rape		doc162
what if it's an aciddent , ect.) in this situation the conclusion is that Abortions should'nt be banned.		doc162
Why should a mother have the right to dispose of her 'mistake'		doc163
Dont want a baby?		doc163
dont have sex!!!		doc163
I dont think you really read my comment		doc164
your missing my point		doc164
The topic is		doc164
 Abortion Should be banned		doc164
and sense therre ar diffrent situations such as		doc164
 accidents		doc164
rape		doc164
abortion shouldnt be banned.		doc164
OK but what about all the other cases, which are probably 90% of abortions		doc165
Why should someone be allowed to get an abortion just because they do not want to live with the consequences of their actions?		doc165
No, she should give it up for adoption and be proud she gave a loving home a child they would not have had otherwise.		doc166
Of course it should be banned		doc167
Abortion became legal in America in the 1800s and was banned -became illegal - when Americans got their consciences back through a spiritual revival across the nation		doc167
At the bare minimum abortion is the taking of one person's life		doc167
But when you consider that most people have children and their children have children		doc167
it opens a whole nother door regarding the massiveness of just one act of abortion		doc167
It equals genocide - on a massive		doc167
massive scale		doc167
My position is that abortion is unconscionable and should forever be banned and illegal.		doc167
What's funny is that the number of abortions performed were higher when abortion was illegal than when it was legal		doc168
and since Roe vs Wade, abortions have continually decreased		doc168
And, keeping it illegal doesn't stop abortions from happening		doc168
So instead of a legal procedure		doc168
being conducted in a safe environment		doc168
we're going to end up with a bunch of illegal abortions		doc168
in unsafe and unregulated environments		doc168
At the bare minimum, it's the destruction of an accumulation of cells		doc168
Depending on the week or trimester		doc168
a zygote is not alive--can't even respond to stimuli		doc168
and therefore cannot be murdered or killed		doc168
it doesn't. A zygote isn't a		doc168
class of people"		doc168
it isn't even a person yet		doc168
There are more murders So		doc168
Unconscionable doesn't mean it should be made illegal.		doc168
sigh I want to say yes for the most part		doc169
I think if people are mature enough to have sex (knowing the consequences of it)		doc169
they should be mature enough to handle the fallout from it		doc169
It should not be used as a form of birth control		doc169
If you don't want a child, don't have sex		doc169
Simple as that		doc169
then the issue of rape comes into play		doc169
Along with the health of the mother at risk		doc169
These are two major issues that throw a wrench into my thoughts on abortion		doc169
But those would be the only reasons I feel abortion would be		doc169
acceptable".		doc169
Although abortion is such a sadening thing that hurts me i dont feel that it should be banned		doc170
Every mother should have the right to do what they want to do and what they think is best.		doc170
What about the child who has no say		doc171
When do we start holding people accountable for their actions?		doc171
it is also the mother's choice		doc172
the child doesnt have no say		doc172
as i said they shouldnt be having any sexual activity		doc172
Its not a child , its a fetus		doc173
It has no feelings at all		doc173
abortions are made to early for the fetus to feel anything.		doc173
isnt that a good thing that they dont feel anything		doc174
would you want the fetus to feel it?		doc174
True however, we were all a fetus at one time		doc175
therefore, it is the beginning of life		doc175
A life that many families are dieing to take care of because they cannot have children of their own.		doc175
thats when the seriousness comes in		doc176
thats when abortion is required		doc176
BUT THERES ADOPTION~~		doc176
She can give the child to someone who wants it		doc177
Many families are looking to adopt.		doc177
I'm against abortions for the most part		doc178
I don't believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control as with upwards of 80% of the cases		doc178
There are ways to prevent pregnancy which are very effective and to me if a person ignores the use of birth control they should assume responsibility for their actions		doc178
On the other hand		doc178
there are many instances where birth control has failed		doc178
cannot be taken due to allergies		doc178
or where rape is a contributing factor to where I would support a woman’s decision if she where to not go through with the pregnancy		doc178
As for not being able to sustain a baby financially		doc178
emotionally, or intellectually, adoption is an option		doc178
saying that you want to abort because you didn't feel like taking or wearing birth control is a poor excuse and shouldn't be encouraged or supported.		doc178
Yes, because of awful application or use of the birth control items		doc179
If every time you had sex you knew there was a large chance you would become pregnant because birth control is not an option due to allergies, I think you should at least think of consequences before you have sex.		doc179
Birth control is not 100 percent effective		doc180
one of my coworkers was on birth control and conceived		doc180
Now she is a proud mother		doc180
Conceiving while on birth control isn't always due to incorrect application or use of the birth control		doc180
sometimes a person just falls into that .01 percent where the birth control failed to do what it was meant to		doc180
In that sense		doc180
considering a person taking it who didn't intend on having a baby and the birth control failed		doc180
I would support her if she decided to have an abortion		doc180
And who's to say those who are allergic to certain types of birth control aren't already considering the possibility of conceiving		doc180
Would thinking		doc180
of the consequences before		doc180
sex		doc180
justify a person’s decision if they conceived and wanted an abortion		doc180
If not then why even bring that up?		doc180
Abortion is immoral because it eliminates life		doc181
When it comes to rape		doc181
women can have choice to abort or not abort		doc181
I support either decision		doc181
it is immoral to abort always		doc181
I also believe it is selfish		doc181
If you are just careless, don't abort		doc181
It is not the anybody's fault but the female's fault		doc181
Why not the man's fault too		doc181
Because the woman allowed the man to fertilize her egg		doc181
when a woman's get pregnant		doc181
it is the woman's fault only		doc181
Except when the situation comes to rape but this is not rape		doc181
But this topic is pointless		doc181
Selfish or not		doc181
a murderer will kill		doc181
a rapists will rape		doc181
abortionist		doc181
will abortion		doc181
Keep an eye on the woman		doc181
You can and i believe you are doing a good deed		doc181
But i am not going to spend the rest of my life watching over a woman and stopping her from getting an abortion EVERY time		doc181
It is sad what i have said		doc181
That i won't help		doc181
But i have a life and this is not what i want to do with my life		doc181
To put this in short		doc181
if a woman wants to get an abortion		doc181
SHE WILL GET AN ABORTION		doc181
I believe adoption is a good option		doc181
And i believe it should be an only option		doc181
My opinion is similiar to ColdFire		doc181
This is my opinion		doc181
I am Pro And Con		doc181
Im ProCon		doc181
And im not yelling		doc181
:) Edit		doc181
Im an idiot		doc181
It is both the man's fault and the woman's fault for the woman getting pregnant		doc181
What was i thinking?		doc181
You know that sperm doesn't ask permission before it fertilizes an egg		doc182
right		doc182
The man allowed his sperm to fertilize her egg?		doc182
and blame the man		doc182
Why not blame them both equally for engaging in consensual sex		doc182
Or why not blame anybody		doc182
because that doesn't help anything		doc182
Accidental pregnancies can happen to anybody		doc182
no matter how careful they are		doc182
To think a woman must carry out a pregnancy just because she dared to have sex is vindictive		doc182
Pregnancy should not be used as a form of punishment.		doc182
In dispute, i don't care about accidental pregnancies		doc183
Sex have risks and whenever a couple engages in sex		doc183
they should be ready for the risks		doc183
I edited myself in my previous comment		doc183
Of course it is both the man's and woman's fault for the woman being pregnant		doc183
Excuse me for my ignorance		doc183
I thought about it some more		doc184
I think even tho both male and female are responsible for the pregnancy		doc184
the female is more responsible		doc184
She allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg		doc184
If you only 'blame' the man when he rapes the woman, shouldn't you conversely only blame the woman if she rapes the man		doc184
In consensual sex		doc184
both partners are equally involved in the decision to give the sperm and the egg the opportunity to meet		doc184
"she allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg		doc184
like it came knocking on the door of her egg and she decided to let it in		doc184
What do you feel is gained from assigning blame to anybody		doc184
I don't believe in accidental pregnancies		doc184
what if a condom breaks		doc184
That is why on the box it says 99 percent safe		doc184
ac·ci·den·tal 1. happening by chance or accident		doc184
not planned		doc184
unexpected		doc184
an accidental meeting		doc184
2. nonessential		doc184
incidental		doc184
subsidiary		doc184
accidental benefits		doc184
3. a nonessential or subsidiary circumstance		doc184
characteristic, or feature		doc184
I would think a review of the definition would be enough to show that yes		doc184
accidental pregnancies exist		doc184
When you engage in an activity		doc184
you are not automatically consenting to allow the potential negative consequences of that activity to run their course without interference		doc184
every time you get in a car		doc184
you realize there is a possibility you will get in a car accident		doc184
This does not mean you are consenting to being injured without trying to reverse or mitigate your injuries		doc184
You are engaging in activity		doc184
recognizing the risks and doing your best to prevent them while still intending to undo any damage that may occur		doc184
Removing any sentimentality from the issue of abortion		doc184
Pregnancy is an occasional consequence of sex and abortion is a way of dealing with that consequence.		doc184
In my point of view, abortion shouldn't be banned		doc185
Abortion is a not bad thing for women		doc185
especially for teenagers		doc185
Everybody thinks that abortion is wrong		doc185
but most of those people even haven't been pregnant		doc185
It is easier to talk about it and to say that women shouldn't have an abortion		doc185
but when it happens it is very hard to make a choice		doc185
When people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong		doc185
they judge women who had an abortion		doc185
We cannot judge people		doc185
Abortion is not very good		doc185
But it is not wrong		doc185
It is a choice		doc185
It is a choice of those women who cannot take responsibility for children because of some reasons		doc185
just imagine, you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant		doc185
You have no husband		doc185
your boyfriend said that it is your problem		doc185
Your family has no money to take care for your child and you even haven't finished a school yet		doc185
Do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong		doc185
I don't think so		doc185
even for a minute you would think about abortion		doc185
What would I do in that situation		doc185
I would think a lot		doc185
But if my situation was very very bad		doc185
I would have an abortion		doc185
Of course, I would never forget about that		doc185
And when I grew up and became an adult with a work		doc185
with a husband and with money I would adopt a child		doc185
I can explain why		doc185
Abortion is a murder		doc185
I agree with that		doc185
But everybody has a right to be wrong		doc185
Everybody makes mistakes		doc185
And we shouldn't afraid to make them		doc185
We should fix our mistakes		doc185
It is called a responsibility		doc185
if you do something wrong		doc185
fix it		doc185
We should use this rule everywhere		doc185
as well with abortion		doc185
As I said earlier		doc185
abortion is a murder		doc185
And how to fix a murder		doc185
If you killed a child, give a life for another child		doc185
It is a solution for that		doc185
How to fix other problems		doc185
if you stole $1000		doc185
give somebody $1000		doc185
If you broke a tree, plant a new tree		doc185
If you messed up a book in a library, apologize and buy them a new book		doc185
if you killed someone		doc185
give a life for someone		doc185
I can say that all of us make mistakes		doc185
we are not perfect		doc185
But we have to think without emotions and to fix our mistakes		doc185
if woman has capabilities to take care for the child		doc185
it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him		doc185
But if woman decided not to have a child		doc185
it is not wrong		doc185
It is not good		doc185
but not wrong.]		doc185
No abortion is wrong		doc186
It's as simple as that it is an option but an evil one		doc186
However that being said I do think that having laws against it really doesn't make sense people ought to have the choice that does not however on any terms make it right.		doc186
I believe that abortion is something we should embrace as an option but not as the only solution		doc187
I saw an awful interview with a woman who		doc187
survived abortion		doc187
during the seventh month of her mothers pregnancy		doc187
She of course is now a pro lifer and spews misinformation about Obama being a baby killer		doc187
Nowadays abortions are not typically done at that point of a pregnancy		doc187
If a baby cannot survive outside the womb, or outside of an artificial womb known as an incubator		doc187
there is nothing morally or ethically wrong about aborting that said baby		doc187
A child changes the lives of many people involved		doc187
If that child cannot be brought into a life of happiness and a healthy, stable environment- they really don't need to be brought into the world at all		doc187
We're there medically		doc187
according to an above poster		doc187
it is the woman's fault		doc187
then it of course is also the woman's choice		doc187
There's no point in fighting for something that isn't a living breathing thing- embryos do NOT count		doc187
I'm against abortion		doc188
An abortion can result in medical complications later in life		doc188
In the future		doc188
woman who did abortion may never be a mother		doc188
Another reason is that this is reduce human rights		doc188
The unborn child is alive from the moment of conception and has the right to life.		doc188
About rights		doc189
A woman also has the right to decide what happens to her body		doc189
Just imagine that a little girl was violenced by maniac and what must she do		doc189
Give a birth for this unwanted baby		doc189
I don't think so		doc189
It is wrong to bring unwanted children into the world		doc189
because in the future this child will live and doesn't know what mother's love is.		doc189
Baby is a gift from God		doc190
Kill a baby is a crime		doc190
When a woman has an abortion		doc190
she will always think about the baby she might have had		doc190
She will always think about the future that could have happened with her baby which will always remind her that she killed it		doc190
Because she has had an abortion		doc190
she will never have a good life		doc190
and her conscience will remind her of what she had done.		doc190
Abortion is not murder - as it destroys a collection of cells that can't survive outside of the mother's womb before the 24th week		doc191
If a woman feels she isn't ready for a baby or doesn't have the means to take care of a baby or just doesn't wish to have a baby		doc191
Like any other difficult situation		doc191
abortion creates stress		doc191
Yet the American Psychological Association found that stress was greatest prior to an abortion		doc191
and that there was no evidence of post-abortion syndrome.		doc191
Doesn't the fetus have the same right to its own body		doc192
Stop with the emotional appeals		doc192
If every human being( irregardless of if they are human		doc192
persons") has the right to life and to what happens to their body, then a fetus		doc192
by being a human being		doc192
also has those rights		doc192
For preemptive reasons		doc192
If a fetus is not a human being, then what stops us from denying babies		doc192
old people, or others with limited functionality as being human beings		doc192
Is it not wrong for a person to decide if another's life is worth while		doc192
I would of reckoned that is for each individual to decide.		doc192
If someone is using your body as a life support machine, don't you think you should have the right to decide if they continue to do so		doc193
Even if that person is your own offspring, even if that person is a completely self-aware adult		doc193
your body should not be used for anything against your ongoing permission		doc193
If physical autonomy is less important than another human's life, then the door is opened for things like government mandated organ donation.		doc193
Exactly, which is why it is her own fault she is pregnant in the first place.		doc194
Just because the child is unwanted does not mean it is unloved furthermore there are far more suitable alternatives like adoption		doc195
simply put abortion is 99% of the time wrong		doc195
because whenever one hundred percent people freak out like WHAT IF THIS HAPPENED!!?		doc195
You are sickening		doc196
The odds of a mother not being able to have children later are so low		doc196
WOMEN CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL THEY'D LIKE TO DO WITH THEIR OWN BODIES		doc196
I don't care what your sociopathic disgusting god says.		doc196
Then maybe they should make better choices with regards to birth control		doc197
It's their fault they're pregnant		doc197
And don't give me that rape argument		doc197
only 1% of abortions happen because of rape.		doc197
Buddy, you're definitely right about the rape situation		doc198
Only 1% percent		doc198
But what you don't understand is that you have no business getting into their business		doc198
They don't need to justify their actions to you		doc198
And a fetus isn't a human		doc198
Not even close		doc198
Only a biblical retard would believe that.		doc198
Whether you agree or not		doc199
abortion will always play an active role in our society		doc199
more than 4000 cases of abortion are reported on daily basis		doc199
While for one, abortion can be a highly miserable experience		doc199
to the other, having a forced child can be a highly miserable experience		doc199
It’s impossible to go by a rule book		doc199
because it's life.		doc199
People should have the choice to keep their baby or not		doc200
If you think its wrong, don't do it		doc200
But people should have the right to make the choices that affect their life.		doc200
I realize that adoption affects the parents lives as well		doc201
but would it not be better than killing it		doc201
Won't killing the fetus have a potential emotional side-effect on the parent		doc201
They would go through life knowing that they killed their own child.		doc201
I believe that if a parent can take care if a child then they shouldn't be able to get an abortion		doc202
but sometimes a child being born causes great strain on the parents and could possibly lead to death		doc202
I believe that it should be the person's choice.		doc202
ummmm no you are so wrong in my opinon		doc203
i think that if you are adult enough to have sex you better be adult enough to take on the responsibilites that come along with having sex.		doc203
What happens if the mother is raped		doc204
Could you ask her to live with the offspring of a obviously demented rapist		doc204
Being a mother is hard enough to add that to it as well		doc204
What if the child in the womb is damaged or deficient beyond help		doc204
A young mother that is duped and lied to by some swaggering Lothario that walks out and leaves her with the child		doc204
There are many situations under which you are completely wrong		doc204
People need to take responsibility for the amount of children being born into broken homes and poverty		doc204
Poverty breeds just look at the street children in calcutta or the child soldiers in Sierra Leone a lot of this stems from religious belief as religion		doc204
lack of education and poverty all go hand in hand.		doc204
It would be really unfair if the mother was raped and she has to bear the emotional pain of having the child		doc205
If the mother was careless and say she was in high school, she would have to drop out of high school to take care of her child		doc205
In this cases I think abortion should be legal		doc205
Its true that the mother should have been more careful but should she ruin her whole life with one mistake		doc205
Through all this what about the child's feelings		doc205
If the mother was raped would she be able to take care of the child properly without having a emotional grudge against the child		doc205
I heard that the pain from rape never truly leaves you		doc205
you move on but you never truly get over it		doc205
The child would also have to grow up without a father		doc205
If the mother gave birth to the child in high school, she would have to drop out		doc205
The child will not be able to receive the full attention the child deserves from his mother if shes trying to take care of the child and study/work at the same time		doc205
It would be even worse if the father did not take responsibility like in some cases of teenage pregnancy		doc205
In other cases where women of any age are pregnant but are not prepared to take care of the child they give the child for adoption		doc205
The child would grow up in an orphanage without ever knowing his real parents		doc205
If the child is adopted, how would the child feel		doc205
The child might live with hate for his biological parents for as long as he lives and if he is not		doc205
does the child deserve to grow up in an orphanage without parents		doc205
So this is why I support abortion.		doc205
The debate of abortion goes further than 'killing' a fetus		doc206
What you are saying is 100% correct		doc206
We are humans		doc206
we do stupid things and accidents do happen		doc206
There is no point in bringing life into this world if there are no structures in place to support this life.		doc206
The problem people have with abortion is the image they have of a baby dieing in the mother's womb		doc207
Unless you can remember what it was like in and coming out of your mother during birth then you can not argue that baby's know that they are dying		doc207
Babies in the womb are not thinking and do not have brain function other than to keep their organs functioning		doc207
People all need to realize that if a baby is not going to make it		doc207
the mother is not going to make it		doc207
or both aren't going to make it through birth		doc207
By disallowing the option of abortion to that mother		doc207
not only do you deny the mother who will die the right to Live but also you deny that baby a mother.		doc207
I believe early abortions are ethically sound because all you have at that point is a clump of cells -- not a human being		doc208
Destroying a clump of cells is not murder		doc208
I believe late abortions are wrong because at that point you have an almost fully developed human capable of thought and feeling		doc208
Killing a developed fetus is murder		doc208
So we are forced to draw a line somewhere and say		doc208
"After this point, abortion is illegal.		doc208
I believe Roe v. Wade did a reasonable job of drawing this line -- after six to seven months abortion is illegal.		doc208
Regardless of how developed it is, it shall develop later		doc209
A two-month fetus has no memories		doc209
no sentience		doc209
But, in a few months, it shall become a 'human' in the legal sense		doc209
Why does the mother have a choice on whether the baby lives or not?		doc209
Potential life doesn't matter		doc210
If you could somehow turn every speck of dust into a human being, then every speck of dust could be considered potential life		doc210
Would it then be morally wrong to destroy a speck of dust		doc210
of course not, because potential life doesn't carry moral weight		doc210
only actual life		doc210
The mother has a choice because		doc210
1) Pregnancy is a pain in the ass 2) Childbirth is dangerous and 3) If she goes through with the pregnancy she will have a human being she will be obligated to care for.		doc210
Pregnancy is a pain in the ass I would be willing to go through tremendous pangs to save a life		doc211
Why else do soldiers get injured/killed trying to save people from minefields		doc211
Childbirth is dangerous Just how often to mothers die during childbirth now-a-days		doc211
Two answers to that		doc211
Put the baby up for adoption		doc211
Leave the baby at a firestation		doc211
Potential life		doc211
A fetus is alive		doc211
regardless of how developed it is		doc211
That alone should give it more rights than some damn speck of dust!		doc211
A one month old embryo is only alive in the strict biological sense		doc212
the same way a plant is alive		doc212
Why is ok to destroy a plant but not an embryo		doc212
Neither one can feel pain		doc212
It's only wrong to kill a developed human being.		doc212
Regardless of whether it is fully developed, it surely shall become so soon		doc213
thirty years ago (or however old you are)		doc213
you mother may have decided to abort you		doc213
You are saying that it would be her choice		doc213
but would you have opted for it		doc213
It is not her life		doc213
Wouldn't you rather be alive		doc213
How about the millions of others who have been aborted over the years		doc213
Why don't they have a say in the matter?		doc213
I'm asking you why it's wrong to destroy potential life		doc214
You're saying it's wrong to destroy potential life because it will become life		doc214
In other words		doc214
it's wrong to destroy potential life because it's potential life		doc214
This is circular reasoning		doc214
Embryos don't have a say in the matter because they are not yet humans		doc214
If I had been aborted as an embryo I would not have given one rat's ass, because I would have been incapable of doing so		doc214
No harm		doc214
no foul		doc214
The world keeps spinning		doc214
What's the big deal?		doc214
Just because it isn't born yet		doc215
what makes it any less of a human?		doc215
Abortion rights are being abused		doc216
It should not be looked at like an easy form of contaception		doc216
"People ought to abstain from sex or practise safe sex.		doc216
Yeah ive heard that argument before 		doc216
Abortion is a serious matter and unfortunately there are cases in which an abortion is neccesary		doc216
articles/goodwin.html		doc216
I agree that there are times when an abortion is necessary		doc217
but when one want's to kill over the fear of parenthood - that is when things are getting out of hand.		doc217
since abortion became legal in the US in 1973 50 million abortions have been performed		doc218
that would knock out 15 states with no1 in them		doc218
that ridiculous		doc218
there are millions of people in the world who would love to have children but cant		doc218
and we have millions of people having sex and not being able to handle the consequences of pregnancy		doc218
if u have sex u better be ready to have babies too.		doc218
there isn't a surplus of orphans or anything./ Should women who don't want kids have them anyway out of guilt for people who can't?		doc219
That's stupid		doc219
stupid		doc219
So a woman should go out of her way to NOT solve a problem just because she got herself into it		doc219
If you tripped and broke your arm should you NOT get a cast on it just because you were foolish enough to trip		doc219
maybe you shouldn't have been walking if you weren't ready to handle the possibility of breaking your arm		doc219
Maybe you should of had the good sense to wear a bubble-wrap suit		doc219
Why does that backwards logic only apply to abortion then?		doc219
It is not a problem		doc220
it is a life		doc220
A broken arm is an injury		doc220
easily mended		doc220
When a person's life ends		doc220
there can be to going back		doc220
It is in no way backward logic		doc220
You are equating a human life to a broken bone		doc220
If it weren't for that life there would be no bone to break!		doc220
Sure there is, you can make another kid later when your ready		doc221
But what about the loss of life that has already taken place?		doc221
Well hey, it has the potential to do all those things		doc222
You can't know it wont		doc222
Why is a sperm suddenly too precious to let die just because it meets an egg		doc222
Especially when any other sperm can do the same damn thing		doc222
Sperm and fetus are the same		doc222
the only difference is a fetus is a few steps closer to being birthed		doc222
You're older than me		doc222
probably a few steps closer to making your own children than I am		doc222
Is your life worth more than mine		doc222
Surely you must think so		doc222
A fetus is closer to being born than a sperm		doc222
just as you are closer to creating a fetus than I am		doc222
You're one step farther on the chain		doc222
so, is it alright for people like me to die en masse as long as you get to live		doc222
I am farther along the chain of life than a fetus		doc222
I am much more capable of creating life than a fetus		doc222
I have much more potential at this time		doc222
the fetus has the potential to one day be like me		doc222
but right now it is not		doc222
That means it's worth less right		doc222
Is it o.k. to abort millions of un-born children but not o.k. to kill me		doc222
But at the same time		doc222
it is o.k. to let millions of sperm die		doc222
but wrong to kill a fetus		doc222
Because one is farther down the road of life than the other		doc222
Or is the life of a fetus worth more than any other conceivable form of life?		doc222
I agree with Kmac		doc223
If you think you are old enough to have sex then you better be old enough and ready to deal with the possible consequences of having sex		doc223
There is always that possibility of becoming pregnant		doc223
so if you have sex and get pregnant deal with it!		doc223
Abortion is just wrong		doc223
Why kill someone that has done nothing wrong		doc223
The baby should not have to pay for your mistakes		doc223
If you can't handle having a child then let someone adopt it, don't kill it!		doc223
Many proponents of abortion say that it is up to the mother to decide what happens to her body		doc224
they seem to be forgetting one key matter		doc224
does the baby not have a choice as to it's body		doc224
Some say that cancer is alive and that by killing it we are ending a life		doc224
cancer will never gain sentience		doc224
cancer will never learn		doc224
cancer will never go to school		doc224
Cancer is like a parasite		doc224
feeding off of the body and expanding until the body is dead		doc224
I am completely for the use of the term 'fetus.' The excuse for the abortion is that the baby is not yet a baby		doc224
rather only a fetus		doc224
That is where they are wrong		doc224
A fetus is just as much a human as I am		doc224
it simply has not progressed to the point in life I which I have reached		doc224
Soon it shall be a baby		doc224
then it shall progress to toddlerhood		doc224
then to childhood, then to adolescence		doc224
It is not a baby		doc224
but it shall become one - just as an adolescent is not an adult		doc224
kmac and princessjess are right abortion is murder		doc225
if you feel that you cant take care of the child		doc225
adoption is an option		doc225
there are families in this world that can not have children		doc225
why not give the baby to them so it can be happy and have a good life		doc225
there is nothing wrong with adoption		doc225
Some would argue that the adopted parents will not love them as much		doc226
Whether or not this is true		doc226
I believe it preferrable to murder.		doc226
OK first off Abortion IS murder weather you believe it or not it IS		doc227
Scott Peterson in trial was convicted of TWO murders not ONE but TWO why two though		doc227
He just killed his wife		doc227
His wife was pregnant		doc227
The baby inside of his wife was killed in the process of the mother being killed		doc227
If the supreme court agrees with abortions yet charge Peterson with two murders what are they thinking?		doc227
Once the a egg is fertilized and starts to grow into a human body it has a human		doc227
spirit		doc227
soul		doc227
inside of it (for those who are religious). So if you were to		doc227
dispose		doc227
of this body that IS alive and has a human		doc227
soul		doc227
within it isn't it the same as murder		doc227
Your taking away the life of some creature that has not yet experienced life yet		doc227
The baby moves		doc227
blinks, kicks, and squirms inside the mother, this is the sign that it is alive and is capable of understanding of what is doing (not of everything its doing) and human beings do just the same		doc227
So lets put a full grown man/women inside a glass incubator filled with water and have them semi-conscious		doc227
And then lets put a drug in there to kill this person		doc227
put a giant vacuum tube into the container and suck all there body parts out		doc227
Is this murder		doc227
Some people will say		doc227
that isn't the same		doc227
That person is fully developed and eduacated		doc227
There is no difference between killing the grown body and that of a one inside a mother		doc227
Weather it's there choice or not to get the abortion it IS still murder		doc227
People should understand the consequences of having sex and abortion should not be a option		doc227
It leads to people saying		doc227
Oh I can just get it aborted so I don't have to worry about it.		doc227
&lt;- LAZINESS		doc227
We already have enough lazy citizens in the US I don't think we need anymore.		doc227
Is this a quantifiable statement		doc228
Are we capable of saying that 2 minutes after conception		doc228
that bundle of 8 or so cells is not just a human being		doc228
but has an intangible		doc228
soul". And those toe nails i just clipped that are made up of millions of cells		doc228
or if a hair gets plucked along with the root that still has a lot more than 8 cells		doc228
those have souls too		doc228
At what point is the now separate entity no longer		doc228
If one wears protections, is that not killing potential for having something with a		doc228
soul"		doc228
Or is the woman's period also murder because it also is killing the potential for a new human being?		doc228
I really don't understand how it's possible to say that a human being		doc228
having been alive		doc228
having consciousness		doc228
can be compared (even in a drugged stupor) to a collection of relatively inanimate bunches of cells		doc228
I agree that at a certain point		doc228
when the fetus has begun to kick and to show brain activity		doc228
that it is now murder to have an abortion		doc228
But up until that point		doc228
I believe the mother has a right to terminate the pregnancy		doc228
Additionally		doc228
you are forming your opinion based on an assumption that all accidental pregnancies happen through laziness		doc228
But what if the child has some terrible genetic disease that will render their life to be agonizing		doc228
I remember someone referenced a disease on CD where the baby lives for about an hour after birth in terrible pain		doc228
Wouldn't it then be mercy then to prevent this from happening before the bunch of cells has become conscious		doc228
Or if the woman was a victim of rape or incest		doc228
and she got pregnant		doc228
I doubt that she would love this child if she carried it to term		doc228
and so the child would probably be emotionally malnourished the rest of its life		doc228
Would you want to sentence someone to that kind of life		doc228
okay the courts and legislature have agreed to your point of view		doc228
Abortions are now illegal		doc228
that does not mean that people wanting abortions aren't going to happen		doc228
and it also doesn't mean that people will stop getting abortions		doc228
Women who don't want to or can't carry a child to term will be forced to go to back alley doctors to perform the abortion (or perhaps worse		doc228
try to do it themselves) and those unqualified doctors' abortions could lead to their own death in addition to the fetus'. Also		doc228
those back alley doctors will no longer have restrictions placed upon them		doc228
They will be able to terminate a pregnancy well after consciousness has begun and the fetus is now a baby		doc228
Even when abortion is legal, this kind of stuff happens too much		doc228
and imagine how much worse it would be if abortion by qualified doctors was illegal.		doc228
I say these types of things in my head when I read some debates but		doc229
I don't post it		doc229
Alright		doc229
let me put it this way		doc229
Once a human		doc229
organism		doc229
is made it is alive		doc229
Whither people like it or not it is fact that it is alive		doc229
It moves		doc229
it eats		doc229
it grows		doc229
it thinks		doc229
Are these not all the contributing factors of how our bodies are alive?		doc229
Absolutely, and I think that most of us on the pro-choice side would agree that a woman's right to chose ends by the time a fetus reaches the stage where it eats or thinks		doc230
But the anti-abortion side is not content with that		doc230
They want to outlaw abortion from the very moment of conception		doc230
at which time the		doc230
organism		doc230
as you call it does not eat		doc230
does not move and does not think.		doc230
Thats not laziness thats disgusting		doc231
Abortion rights are being abused		doc231
It should not be looked at like an easy form of contaception.		doc231
I don't think that it should be completely pro life		doc232
but rather what the circumstances are		doc232
For example, if the abortion is because of rape		doc232
incest, mother's life is in danger		doc232
then I completely understand the reason		doc232
if abortion is done because protection		doc232
either a condom or birth control pills, were not used		doc232
then abortion should not be allowed		doc232
Be responsible for your own actions.		doc232
Please not that this debate has nothing to do with the legality of abortion		doc233
I believe that it is better off being legal		doc233
but moderated as well		doc233
If the mother wants an abortion bad enough she shall get the fetus out any way possible, but if it were illegal she would be going into dark alleys to get it done.		doc233
I strongly think that we should stop abortion		doc234
if you don't want the baby put it up for adoption		doc234
I'm sure there are hundred of families who would love that baby as it's own		doc234
Couples out there who cant produce offspring that desire a baby		doc234
Then your taking away something you can get and they can't.		doc234
Yes, but are there enough homes for 50,000,000 babies		doc235
Is there enough food to feed 50,000,000 more mouths		doc235
Will there be enough food to feed 100,000,000s more babies in generations to come?		doc235
Abortion is immoral		doc236
The law prohibits it		doc236
The growing fetus has a presumptive personality by which the state has a responsibility.		doc236
Abortion is immoral to anyone with a heart and a sense of what is right and wrong		doc237
But our law in America allows a mother to kill her unborn child		doc237
as long as she hires it done		doc237
If she does it herself she may face being charged with taking a life		doc237
Our laws are whishy washy about this		doc237
They do not give the unborn personhood and protection		doc237
they stand on the principle that its the womans body and then they stipulate when she can have the abortion		doc237
Science is clear to when human life starts		doc237
and it does not start after nine months of pregnancy.		doc237
Yeah sure, I'm pro-choice		doc238
pro-choice in the sense that the choice is made when the soon-to-be mother chose to act irresponsibly and have unprotected sex		doc238
So many liberals out there try to paint this idealistic picture that you can make stupid decisions without any real consequences		doc238
but that's simply not true		doc238
When you have unprotected sex		doc238
a baby is conceived		doc238
At that moment		doc238
whether the baby has a pumping heart or not		doc238
it becomes a mother's natural and personal responsibility to do what is best for the baby		doc238
That could mean one of many options		doc238
such as raising the baby yourself		doc238
putting it up for adoption		doc238
or any number of alternatives		doc238
as basic human decency should tell you		doc238
that anyone arguing that the termination of that baby is what's best for the baby is wrong in the most perverse way conceivable		doc238
You chose to act irresponsibly		doc238
Now you must face the consequences		doc238
and just because you don't want to does NOT give you the right to terminate the existence of a potential human being		doc238
of course there are cases of rape and/or incest conceptions		doc238
In these cases		doc238
I do not feel that the mother should be forced to carry a child she does not deserve to have		doc238
She did nothing wrong		doc238
and should not be forced to carry the offspring of her rapist		doc238
But at the same time		doc238
I still believe that life begins at conceptions		doc238
and at that point it become a moral judgment for the mother to make		doc238
Do you believe in giving life to another human being		doc238
filling it with opportunity to make a name for himself or herself		doc238
or do you believe that you'd like to deliver children following consensual and natural intercourse between a man and a woman		doc238
At that point		doc238
the government should have nothing to do at all with the mother's say		doc238
she is no longer the irresponsible one		doc238
but rather the victim of a gruesome and despicable crime.		doc238
You chose to act irresponsibly		doc239
I got pregnant whilst using the contraceptive pill		doc239
it's not as uncommon as you think		doc239
Don't assume every person who is pregnant isn't responsible		doc239
Just to clarify I didn't abort her		doc239
I have a daughter		doc239
However I'm just using this as a point that not all accidental pregnancies are because people are stupid enough to have sex without contraception		doc239
rape and incest aren't the only circumstance that warrant abortion		doc239
Have you considered medical problems		doc239
deformities and disabilities in an unborn baby		doc239
What about a heroin addict, a alcoholic		doc239
What about someone with severe mental health problems (bi-polar, schizophrenia, BPD)		doc239
How about a homeless person		doc239
Do you think it is okay in these cases		doc239
I don't think any situation should dictate whether a Mother decides to proceed with a pregnancy		doc239
It's how the mother (or doctor) perceives the circumstance of her pregnancy		doc239
If she feels the unborn child would have a negative life or her life would be impacted seriously (not superficially) then she has the right to terminate her pregnancy.		doc239
If you are a woman and have a brain you know that any birth control method can fail, unless she has had a hysterectomy		doc240
So the woman takes the chance		doc240
it is her decision		doc240
HER RESPONSIBILTY		doc240
It's not always about stupidity		doc240
but that does not chance the responsiblity part or the fact that says		doc240
a human life starts at conception		doc240
Why do you feel that rape and incest warrent abortion		doc240
Is the innocent child in the wombs life less than one in a womb who got there by a mother who was not raped		doc240
Do you think that if you walked into a hospital nursery and you were told that one babys mother had been raped		doc240
that you would be able to pick it out		doc240
Why does two acts of violence make sense		doc240
So the woman goes through the rape and then knowing she killed the child inside her		doc240
Do you know how mothers would cope with this extra trauma		doc240
And are ing that because a child has a deformity that it deserves to die		doc240
Wow		doc240
how compassionate and materialist you are		doc240
ARe you perfect in appearence		doc240
Lets abort babies because they have problems		doc240
Hitler had the same idea did you know that		doc240
He believed in killing the weak		doc240
the dredges of society		doc240
Again you are blaming the unborn for the sins of the parent		doc240
I have personally seen drug babies		doc240
and while they have a hard time at first		doc240
they can be saved and they can lead normal lives		doc240
You are making excuses for the killing		doc240
How about the woman who does not want to get stretch marks		doc240
the woman who wants to finish school		doc240
the woman who does know who the father is		doc240
the woman who does not want another child of that sex		doc240
You know it is sad that you feel this way		doc240
that you would be so judgemental that to solve a problem you have to kill a living human being		doc240
That you would speak for another human who cant speak for themselves		doc240
and choose death		doc240
You are choosing death		doc240
what-if's		doc240
What right do you have to determine how someone MIGHT LIVE		doc240
What if you were poor		doc240
and the government said that everyone who made less than a certain amount couldn't have a child		doc240
that if you got pregnant you would have to abort because if you had one it would be a burdon on society		doc240
What did you mean by your comment		doc240
What right do you have to tell a woman why she cant abort at any time?		doc240
You really are a sexist pig		doc241
The male who has sex with her and impregnates takes half the responsibility for pregnancy		doc241
It's not solely a woman		doc241
Because if a child is going to make her life more awful than what she's already experienced she has the choice to not go through that		doc241
I'm not saying you should abort in these circumstances but I understand entirely why people do		doc241
You are possibly the biggest word mincer ever		doc241
I personally wouldn't abort a child on these grounds and I'm not saying people should		doc241
But yet again I understand and sympathize with someone who does		doc241
.Hitler had the same idea did you know that		doc241
Stop calling and comparing me to Hitler		doc241
It's so rude		doc241
You are making excuses for the killing		doc241
I'm not making excuses		doc241
I'm saying I understand why woman would abort in these situations		doc241
Stop acting like I advocate death and I'm murdering people		doc241
I think that's probably a very selfish reason however I don't know the woman's background maybe she has serious depression and her self esteem is low		doc241
life would be impacted seriously (not superficially)		doc241
Oh and in response to your question about I meant		doc241
I mean personally if someone were to abort because it was the wrong sex or something along those lines I'd probably think it was a bit selfish		doc241
But I wouldn't out right deny the woman the right to do so		doc241
And don't call me a hypocrite		doc241
because I still believe the woman has the right to abort under those circumstances		doc241
This is coming from the person who believes a woman has no right to abort at all		doc241
A woman can abort for whatever reason she likes it has nothing to with me I've never led you to believe that I think only some woman can abort		doc241
And just to clarify I've already posted the scientific studies and facts on when a baby feels pain and it's brain is active		doc241
and why that is my defining limit on abortion gestation with some exception		doc241
If you couldn't be bothered to read it that's your problem.		doc241
What I just said is fact like it or not		doc242
You want to say that abortion should be legal because its her body		doc242
her decision but then you want to blame the man for the risk SHE TOOK		doc242
You look silly		doc242
Our laws say that the baby is not his enough to be a part of the decision		doc242
he has no choice in the matter		doc242
Why men don't see this and storm in outrage I don't know		doc242
Who is the one that gets pregnant		doc242
Can the man get pregnant		doc242
Who takes the risk		doc242
Either you are so young that you don't know better		doc242
or I just don't know		doc242
your ignorant about what responsiblity is		doc242
You are cold		doc242
But then you respresent death to innocent human beings because you are a pro-abort		doc242
You champion killing		doc242
And that is what abortion is		doc242
whether its in the first month		doc242
or ninth		doc242
its killing		doc242
The abortionists goal isnt to shoot a documentary		doc242
or catch a fish		doc242
or play a round of golf		doc242
it is to KILL THAT WHICH IS IN THE WOMANS WOMB		doc242
It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her		doc242
She is the one taking the risk		doc242
not the man		doc242
You're a typical pro-abort all over the place		doc242
not consistent at all		doc242
Sigh If a child is gonna make her life awful		doc242
kill it		doc242
LMAO So compassionate of you		doc242
catticus		doc242
is there something wrong with abortion or not		doc242
You personally believe		doc242
but you still condone		doc242
You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting		doc242
You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds		doc242
well my dear what grounds would you kill		doc242
I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger		doc242
influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood		doc242
Your views on this mirror theirs		doc242
because they acted them out		doc242
Do some research and you will see		doc242
Google		doc242
Sanger and Hitler		doc242
then see if you agree with them		doc242
If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on		doc242
You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler		doc242
LOL Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children		doc242
Do you also defend people who murder		doc242
rape, steal?		doc242
hell		doc242
you make excuses for everything		doc242
You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn		doc242
You are saying death should always be an option		doc242
How do you go to bat for the innocent in the womb		doc242
You don't. You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks		doc242
it was the wrong sex 		doc242
if its deformed		doc242
Do you ever read what you post here and really really think about what and how it sounds		doc242
think What do YOU think any aborted child in the womb would say if they could talk (hell infant babies cant talk either) and address the one who killed them		doc242
the one who presumed they would have a horrible life		doc242
you would not deny a woman the right to kill		doc242
therefore you are pro-abortion		doc242
because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed		doc242
You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car		doc242
and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing		doc242
LOL You pro-aborts kill me		doc242
no pun intended		doc242
What does pain have to do with anything		doc242
The point I was trying to make was		doc242
that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL		doc242
the time you think the fetus can feel pain		doc242
And geeze oh petes		doc242
we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we		doc242
I mean that would be inhumane right		doc242
You are a joke		doc242
the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason		doc242
(the man is not an issue unless money is involved) but that it shouldnt be her responsiblity only		doc242
(what the man should pay for the killing?) you think when the baby can feel pain abortion should not be allowed		doc242
not allowed		doc242
after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable		doc242
I know the studies		doc242
I know people who have done the studies		doc242
The fact is		doc242
that which is in the womb is human		doc242
is alive and is a growing person		doc242
Science is on the side of life and defines it in terms that are not pro-choice		doc242
Life was not concieved to kill in this way		doc242
it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb.		doc242
I can assure the only person who looks silly here is you		doc243
A man is HALF the responsibility of a pregnancy		doc243
It's not my fault that a man has no say in abortion maybe if you actually read what I type you would of seen me say that it's probably unfair that a man by law is denied a say		doc243
However in a lot of circumstances the woman consults with the man and they come to a mutual agreement on whether to continue the pregnancy or not		doc243
A woman gets pregnant a man gets her pregnant they BOTH take the risk		doc243
They are both equally responsible for a pregnancy		doc243
I know far better than you I've had a pregnancy		doc243
I have a daughter		doc243
I have one of the greatest responsibilities an individual faces because I am a parent		doc243
Don't patronize me		doc243
It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are		doc243
Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore		doc243
The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant		doc243
Your opinion is sexist is so many levels		doc243
You don't have to be completely decided on an argument since day one of this debate I stated it's neither right nor wrong it's based on circumstance and how the woman feels		doc243
I don't condemn anyone who has abortion		doc243
I wouldn't have an abortion personally		doc243
Just because I think other people have the right doesn't mean I'd do it myself		doc243
The only reason I'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child		doc243
Are you fucking kidding me		doc243
Here is one of Margaret's views advocate abortions on Afro-Americans in order to eliminate what she called		doc243
socially undesirable people		doc243
so I'm a racist now		doc243
And there is a massive difference here for a start		doc243
I don't believe anyone should be forced to have an abortion it's their choice		doc243
And another She called for the halt to the medical care being given to slum mothers		doc243
and decried the expense to the taxpayers of monies being spent on the deaf		doc243
blind and dependent		doc243
She condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries		doc243
and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy		doc243
Sanger's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die		doc243
I don't agree with ANYTHING this woman promoted or believed		doc243
She didn't believe woman had the right to choose abortion she wanted to force them without a choice		doc243
She is racist scum and I have no common ground with any of these views		doc243
This is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of		doc243
How dare you?. I never denied that I called you a name		doc243
Hypocrite		doc243
All you've done since this debate began is name call		doc243
I will retaliate		doc243
No I don't		doc243
they're not even the same thing		doc243
They're not the same circumstance		doc243
I don't make excuses I share my beliefs and opinions and they vary on all of these subjects		doc243
How is not condemning something making excuses		doc243
Not everyone has to agree with you		doc243
it's not the final word or the truth it's an opinion		doc243
Hold up		doc243
I didn't say it was wrong I said it was a little selfish		doc243
I never said she couldn't. You are a vile		doc243
horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this		doc243
How dare I contribute to abortion		doc243
If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her		doc243
I wouldn't influence her opinion		doc243
If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision		doc243
Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion		doc243
Pain has everything to do with it		doc243
if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it		doc243
I don't have to be entirely pro abortion		doc243
Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought		doc243
Again thanks for the insult		doc243
what a wonderful Christian you are		doc243
You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people		doc243
demeaning them and being downright rude		doc243
Not to mention you lie		doc243
Very Godly		doc243
Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money		doc243
You're wrong		doc243
having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing		doc243
his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is		doc243
If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong		doc243
A date I randomly made up		doc243
No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands		doc243
And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science		doc243
I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you		doc243
Which is where I get my opinion on when I think abortion is okay		doc243
If I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?		doc243
No my dear you do not obviously know the law		doc244
Our government says the child belongs to her		doc244
that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM		doc244
even if he is the father		doc244
If he was recognized as a player		doc244
the law would not be what it is today		doc244
Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either		doc244
That is the law		doc244
The fact is		doc244
the baby is hers at conception….she took the risk		doc244
The sperm leaves his body		doc244
and enters her		doc244
His part is done		doc244
The sperm was a gift		doc244
he certainly can’t ask for it back can he		doc244
LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what		doc244
that is if he wants the baby		doc244
it’s NOT AN ISSUE		doc244
Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way		doc244
but that is the law today		doc244
I believe personally that the man should be considered		doc244
that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion		doc244
Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it		doc244
I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs		doc244
it’s unfair		doc244
You are trying to make yourself feel better look better		doc244
You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember		doc244
Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing		doc244
Am I calling names		doc244
Didn’t you call me a pig		doc244
Better reread that section		doc244
Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion		doc244
Well gee I am sorry		doc244
the truth hurts		doc244
yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it		doc244
Now if the way I described it sounds crass…sorry		doc244
but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made		doc244
Most abortions happen on unwed women		doc244
women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact		doc244
That does not change the fact how they got pregnant		doc244
Why don’t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms		doc244
It still won’t change the truth of how it happened		doc244
As I said AGAIN……….the man is an onlooker so says the law….that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in		doc244
Is that better way to put it		doc244
You are absolutely unbelievable		doc244
You want to blame……and blame you do		doc244
for what is a woman’s issue		doc244
so says the law		doc244
Don’t you have the guts to call it like it is		doc244
If the man is accountable wouldn’t he have a decision in the pregnancy		doc244
NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO		doc244
HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE		doc244
As for condemning anyone for an abortion…this discussion is not about that		doc244
I work with women who have had abortions….because I know what it’s like		doc244
I was one of those women who spread her legs		doc244
It was my call		doc244
my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be		doc244
So don’t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through		doc244
The work I do is in this field		doc244
I see the pain		doc244
And guess what………		doc244
the pain is just not experienced by the woman		doc244
but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children		doc244
The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago		doc244
I would give anything to be able to take that day back…and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way		doc244
You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill		doc244
Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler’s ovens… pro-life		doc244
How about those people that owned slaves		doc244
Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one		doc244
And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate		doc244
Is it an effective way to get your point across		doc244
Of course you will retaliate…you condone abortion which is violence		doc244
You ranted on…… I was making an analogy that you simply did not like		doc244
Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute		doc244
How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull		doc244
If someone drives someone to a robbery….and they are caught….does the police just say….ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye		doc244
If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it		doc244
If the doctor didn’t show up, the nurse refuse to do it…the baby might have a chance		doc244
You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny		doc244
Bolonga…many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it….not just because of pain		doc244
Insult		doc244
Retaliation		doc244
isn’t that what it’s all about		doc244
so yourself didn’t you		doc244
Then you judge me when you think I retaliate….why are you judging me from different standards than you live by………		doc244
LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian		doc244
right		doc244
Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup		doc244
not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN		doc244
No case for abortion can be made scripturally		doc244
Christ would want me to stand up the his little children		doc244
he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin		doc244
devastated my life until I came to Him		doc244
So you don’t like how I put things……		doc244
Christ said		doc244
they hated me first and will hate you as well		doc244
I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth		doc244
You might be the greatest person in the world		doc244
but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice		doc244
because you think it should be legal		doc244
if a woman and man are married……he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion		doc244
He has no rights even though it is his child		doc244
BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION		doc244
She calls the shots		doc244
Now if they were not married		doc244
she can’t hold him financially accountable for anything		doc244
The baby is hers		doc244
unless she puts his name on the birth certificate…and in that case he might for forced to pay		doc244
Well you are wrong again…. James_Elgin_Gill 128 days early… or 21 weeks 5 days early Then there was Amillia Taylor who is also often cited as the most-premature baby		doc244
She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami		doc244
Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation		doc244
At birth she was 9 inches (23 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams). She suffered digestive and respiratory problems		doc244
together with a brain hemorrhage		doc244
She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007		doc244
There are babies like this all over the world being born		doc244
My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days		doc244
She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old		doc244
She weighed just over 1 pound		doc244
I know the information out there…you need to get educated and read a bit more		doc244
instead of just google and posting		doc244
Pain is not an issue….personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all		doc244
You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb		doc244
Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered		doc244
Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks		doc244
right?		doc244
When did I say that wasn't the law		doc245
Do you read anything I type		doc245
Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child		doc245
Can a woman conceive on her own		doc245
Can a man produce a child on his own		doc245
Both sexes are required to conceive a baby		doc245
they are both responsible for the act of conception		doc245
Answer this question please		doc245
Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman		doc245
Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant		doc245
Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort		doc245
Yes he knows all of these things		doc245
And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman		doc245
Therefore he is half responsible		doc245
He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman		doc245
If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on all grounds		doc245
Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by law then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have		doc245
Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you		doc245
Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it		doc245
it’s unfair		doc245
I said what's unfair		doc245
Am I calling names		doc245
Here's a list		doc245
Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me		doc245
Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do		doc245
Name call		doc245
Materialist Judge mental You look silly your ignorant You are cold		doc245
You champion killing sissy Hitler		doc245
Margaret Sanger		doc245
Your views on this mirror theirs		doc245
You are a joke You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny you respresent death to innocent human beings You deserved to be called a pig		doc245
I hate sexism		doc245
I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic		doc245
being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me		doc245
Oh and perhaps you re-read that section because here is what I said I never denied that I called you a name		doc245
Hypocrite		doc245
All you've done since this debate began is name call		doc245
I will retaliate		doc245
I'm not the one in denial		doc245
I called you a pig once		doc245
You've demeaned and name called multiple times		doc245
I know and your point is		doc245
What on earth are you on about		doc245
I've had sex I know what sex entails		doc245
I know how a child is conceived		doc245
this It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her		doc245
She is the one taking the risk		doc245
not the man This is SEXIST		doc245
you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant		doc245
Could a woman get pregnant without a man		doc245
Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived		doc245
There are two things that create a life		doc245
an egg and a sperm		doc245
Half and half		doc245
They both decide to have sex		doc245
they both know the risks		doc245
they both procreate		doc245
They are both responsible		doc245
An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law		doc245
For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself		doc245
girl who is allowing him in The man also allows himself in		doc245
Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex		doc245
If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape		doc245
If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom		doc245
Just as the girl could say no or use a condom		doc245
They both take equal blame		doc245
explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy		doc245
That is how it is I'm afraid		doc245
It takes a man and a woman to procreate		doc245
He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because		doc245
oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN		doc245
because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her		doc245
It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months		doc245
And if you READ what I say		doc245
most fathers do have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement		doc245
All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion		doc245
I had one I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite		doc245
How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you		doc245
And I actually feel very sorry for you		doc245
Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something		doc245
The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible		doc245
It takes two people to make a child		doc245
You cannot create a life on your own		doc245
Again stop lying about things I've said		doc245
in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate		doc245
Telling someone 'I know how you feel'. I see the pain		doc245
especially afterwards I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt		doc245
they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught		doc245
It's abortion		doc245
I never said it was happy fairy la la land		doc245
However they could have felt worse if they had a child		doc245
What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable		doc245
unable to love the child		doc245
Do their emotions mean nothing		doc245
I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process		doc245
stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this		doc245
Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling		doc245
How selfish		doc245
I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too		doc245
Not pro-choice thanks		doc245
I have a limit		doc245
That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense		doc245
What has the holocaust got to do with abortion		doc245
Since they felt pain and were living		doc245
viable humans this has no relation to my opinion		doc245
Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion		doc245
Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now		doc245
I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer		doc245
I don't think calling someone a pig is violent		doc245
how did you come to that conclusion		doc245
I didn't say pain is the only reason people are scared of death		doc245
Stop lying		doc245
I'm not scared of what's beyond it		doc245
I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense		doc245
And if it was true		doc245
which I don't believe it is		doc245
everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God		doc245
I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you		doc245
You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi		doc245
you accused me of being a racist murderer		doc245
And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's		doc245
By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion		doc245
Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer		doc245
Since you had an abortion		doc245
Abortions are free here		doc245
And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong		doc245
They aren't performed like that anymore		doc245
You name called		doc245
you didn't retaliate you instigated		doc245
Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning again if it had of been retaliation		doc245
I'm not judging you by different standards or religion		doc245
I'm just telling you what the Bible says		doc245
isn't that what happens at church every time you go		doc245
Are they judging you		doc245
No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth		doc245
It's worthless quoting the Bible to me		doc245
I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source		doc245
Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to		doc245
Good		doc245
If they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway		doc245
Well you are wrong again…. 128 days early… or 21 weeks 5 days early 02/worlds_youngest.htm Actually she is		doc245
Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age		doc245
Why don't you produce a real argument		doc245
For the final time read what I say		doc245
Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie		doc245
I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains		doc245
Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby		doc245
Why because you post things from Wikipedia		doc245
Wow I wish I had that knowledge		doc245
Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar		doc245
The only things I've posted are links and small quotes		doc245
Everything else is my words		doc245
You ask for evidence you get it.		doc245
I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends		doc245
I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for		doc245
I do not love you		doc245
I do not love strangers whether they be child		doc245
adult, fetus		doc245
At best I like some random people		doc245
That does not mean I don't value other people though		doc245
I value good people		doc245
respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics		doc245
Did you want me to pioneer a revolution		doc245
Do you want to preach to people		doc245
Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death		doc245
But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus		doc245
Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth		doc245
Fuck sakes		doc245
read my words PLEASE		doc245
When does the second trimester begin		doc245
12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain		doc245
derp		doc245
I already said that about 6 times?		doc245
It takes two		doc246
the woman can’t conceive on her own and no man can produce a child on his own		doc246
But that has nothing to do with responsibility		doc246
Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married…does not take him into consideration		doc246
should she want to abort		doc246
He simply is not an issue		doc246
The government recognizes the risks of the woman and awards here the right to decide		doc246
If they are both are responsible for the risks they take…then why are the fathers rights stripped		doc246
he also knows he can walk away if he doesn’t want to be involved		doc246
Two kids having sex on the beach during spring break		doc246
They want to have sex obviously for pleasure		doc246
They might not even know their names or where they are from		doc246
Now who takes the big risk should they get pregnant		doc246
The guy or the gal		doc246
Who can fade into the sunset		doc246
never to be seen or heard from again		doc246
THE MAN She takes the big risk		doc246
What risk did the kid take		doc246
This Cassie Anthony trial…		doc246
she says she has no idea who the father of Caylee was		doc246
She was known for sleeping around and they did DNA samples on many of her acquaintances		doc246
Nothing turned up		doc246
They even did DNA on her father and brother		doc246
Who got pregnant		doc246
who had the baby		doc246
She did…because whether reckless sex happened or not…the risk she took didn’t pan out….she got pregnant….and where is the dad??????		doc246
Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds		doc246
In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it		doc246
And you want to compare your use of the noun Pig…to the descriptions I have used		doc246
Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective		doc246
You gotta come up with something better than this		doc246
LOL A pig is a filthy animal that lives in a sty………LMAO How old are you really		doc246
are you even an adult		doc246
What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible		doc246
And why are you bringing religion into this		doc246
All these humanists bringing religion into debates…when I have not		doc246
Again ignorance…go research what a churchmouse is		doc246
Do you think that Christians because of the love commandment should just take it…roll over and play dead		doc246
Why do you judge me by perfect standards and not yourself		doc246
You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your posts…and makes you look like you have no class		doc246
You use the F bomb like it’s a conjunction		doc246
Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matter…		doc246
but will leave it with these two		doc246
Why don’t you do some heavy research on this…not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google		doc246
Your position is heartless		doc246
cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts		doc246
Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing		doc246
not life		doc246
And this is not championing abortion		doc246
LMAO And you want people to believe your pro-life		doc246
LMAO I said this		doc246
is biology sexist		doc246
The truth is the truth it seeks no sides		doc246
We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it I’m afraid		doc246
The man does not have to assume squat…unless he is married and the courts order him to pay		doc246
Did the kid on the beach have to do anything		doc246
How many one night stands you think happen when the male just takes off…knowing or not knowing if he impregnanted the woman		doc246
He goes on her invite		doc246
If they are running around the bases…have not scored a grand slam… and she says no……		doc246
If he does against her wishes it’s rape		doc246
Instigating has nothing to do with this		doc246
But whose body is changed by the sex act		doc246
She knows that what he might leave behind will affect her for at least nine months		doc246
He knows that it won’t affect him in the least…		doc246
UNLESS HE IS MARRIED		doc246
It does take a man and a woman to procreate…which is why I also am against same sex unions		doc246
it’s not natural…but that’s another debate		doc246
They both have sex….blah blah……		doc246
and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again		doc246
SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK		doc246
Sure some married couples are on the same page….but we will never know how many married women go behind their spouses backs to kill		doc246
because they know their husband would not approve		doc246
There is no way of knowing that statistic		doc246
Why on earth would you of all people be sorry		doc246
Mind boggling to say the least		doc246
I am not a hypocrite		doc246
I simply made a mistake lived in hell and want to share my story		doc246
My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there		doc246
because they want abortion pictures in the best way		doc246
Tell me……Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake		doc246
Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didn’t believe that way all along		doc246
Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors		doc246
we can’t change our minds about issues		doc246
feelings		doc246
Must be nice to be perfect		doc246
Well my position on abortion changed….and I am allowed to change my mind…		doc246
When you make a huge mistake….if you have children don’t you want to protect them		doc246
teach them what might hurt them		doc246
What you’re saying here….is that I do not have the right to change my mind		doc246
I don’t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion		doc246
You are the one who is judgemental and arrogant…		doc246
but then you’re perfect remember		doc246
Oh my goodness don’t. I was not a child when I had it….I should have known better…and I took the risk because I knew what would happen		doc246
But like most others in the heat of passion I guess I didn’t care and did it anyway		doc246
No one thrusted anything on me		doc246
and guess what		doc246
I do not blame anyone but myself		doc246
I am a wonderful person MOST of the time		doc246
not perfect like you but I am ok		doc246
I have raised two wonderful		doc246
happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls		doc246
have been married over thirty years to the SAME MAN….and have a blessed life		doc246
Christ forgave me when I became His		doc246
And I promised Him that abortion would be my witness…to share what HE did for me in my hour of need		doc246
I am the luckiest person in the world		doc246
The baby I aborted was my husbands		doc246
A pregnancy at that time would have been hard		doc246
We were on the same page…until later…when I started suffering		doc246
he could not understand my feelings		doc246
He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different		doc246
because when I became Christs		doc246
he didn’t. Worldviews change….and mine did drastically		doc246
We have adjusted…and he now tolerates my feelings		doc246
actions		doc246
I do not force my beliefs on him		doc246
I pray someday we will be on the same page		doc246
Distraught about what		doc246
Tell me….how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible		doc246
not a fairy lala trip….then go against what your morals tell you is wrong		doc246
I don’t get it		doc246
Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible		doc246
Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…is cold		doc246
compassionless and EMPTY		doc246
Here watch this……		doc246
and if you don’t		doc246
think about the reasons why you won’t. Search your heart…about why you would support something so barbaric		doc246
And if you have children….put them in the place of the tiny one who is getting slaughtered		doc246
I am not Catholic but they always have good stuff on their sites about abortion		doc246
What is upsetting about it		doc246
And who says the kids are young		doc246
I wouldn’t tell a child about abortion for all the obvious reasons		doc246
I would at least wait until the child was the age when a lot of kids are having sex		doc246
I told my kids when they were teenagers		doc246
It’s not selfish…its real life and it happens		doc246
Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television		doc246
What makes abortion different you tell me		doc246
It’s the most performed surgery in the world		doc246
You are pro-abortion period		doc246
end of story		doc246
You want to deceive yourself into thinking you’re not but you are		doc246
You condone what that video I wanted you to watch…shows		doc246
That’s what you think should be legal		doc246
You do not stand up for all life		doc246
Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothing….and looked the other way		doc246
In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down		doc246
Everyone participated……good should have overcome evil		doc246
but didn’t. People act out of fear….and I am sure there were people who did not like what Hitler was doing BUT DIDN’T DO ANYTHING TO STOP HIM…I am talking about the people in his own country….the people who could have physically taken himout….the guards		doc246
Abortion is like that….people sit by and do nothing….they think anything they do….won’t change the laws		doc246
won’t help the victim		doc246
But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion….if every parent with compassion in his heart would stand up for what is right and good…….abortion would once again be considered murder		doc246
If we stood up as a nation about the evils of abortion….wow….how many lives would be changed, hearts mended		doc246
But we are a secular country that has turned its face from God…and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws		doc246
I work with people who are atheists….so it is possible for people with no faith at all to stand up and make a difference		doc246
Its knowing what is right and wrong		doc246
what is good and evil………		doc246
standing up for it		doc246
no matter what		doc246
Again talking about standing up for what is right		doc246
doing the right thing……		doc246
even if you are swimming up stream		doc246
I know the odds are against abortion being overturned are slim to none……but I keep working and praying I am wrong		doc246
Society is sinking into a moral less abyss		doc246
You condone murder….I never called you a racist		doc246
I never use violent adjectives on you….you used a noun to describe me		doc246
And swearing is classless…. Well you hold the cards to your future eternity		doc246
No one else is responsible but you		doc246
And if you’re wrong…you will have all eternity to think about it		doc246
How do you know EVERYONE has been condemned		doc246
And how do you know that you will be recognizable in hell to your family and friends		doc246
If you went to hell with them…		doc246
being with family etc…would be just a tad bit good…you would have support, be near the ones you love		doc246
And if you have support		doc246
then it is not hell		doc246
LOL What happens if you get there and you can’t find anyone		doc246
Well you would have all eternity thrashing about to find them I suppose		doc246
I know many people in my family who will not go…that is their choice		doc246
I bothers me		doc246
and I cry about it sometimes when I am praying		doc246
But I love Christ more than any other person in the world….and I have faith in Him….more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life		doc246
I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it		doc246
Heaven is perfect….and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved		doc246
It’s funny all the nonreligious		doc246
materialists, humanists, atheists, agnostics always bring up religion		doc246
must be they think about it a lot		doc246
LOL I do not feel I called you names		doc246
I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with		doc246
I am certainly not trying to get revenge		doc246
I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good		doc246
I am bold		doc246
and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended		doc246
But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them		doc246
gets them thinking about what they think is ok		doc246
And you think abortion is ok		doc246
And….you are judging me…I point out what that are untruths but I am not judging your heart….I can’t		doc246
scripture does not allow me to do that…not unless you claim to be a Christian		doc246
That is why I bring no scriptures up with you because you don’t know better		doc246
God will judge you		doc246
I can however judge actions (not hearts) of Christians as they can judge mine and many have done that…I thank them for it because many times more than I would like to admit		doc246
I needed judgement		doc246
Why do you quote a book you don’t believe in		doc246
LOL You don’t believe in it		doc246
yet you use it to make a point		doc246
LOL You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion period….live with it accept the label take it as your own		doc246
LOL Boy you are really diggin deep now…. I post rarely from Wikipedia….and on this forum have posted from very reliable sources		doc246
I am not however handing my posts in to be graded….so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation		doc246
I work….I live a full life and when I get on here….I slam it out the fastest way I can		doc246
If I had to hand in an article or paper ….it would be correct		doc246
You have provided however little evidence		doc246
more lies		doc246
Just like the lie about the earliest born preemie….I showed you your error		doc246
I work in this field and I know…. This is your worldview…and explains what I said all along…why you are pro-abortion		doc246
The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart		doc246
I feel sorry for you actually		doc246
Who is setting abortion clinics on fire		doc246
If you compare the acts of violence against how many abortion clinics there are in the world……its nothing		doc246
Pro-lifers are basically kind and compassionate people who respect the law…just try to change it		doc246
Am I preaching		doc246
What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing		doc246
Do you ever look in a mirror		doc246
You simply act like a juvenile		doc246
You have no class		doc246
LOL two things in your post…………you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks….and here 12 weeks it feels pain		doc246
LOL Can’t let this one go……your hilarious		doc246
I mean that in the nicest comedic way possible		doc246
LOL This is what earlier… So is it 12 weeks when the fetus can feel pain….or 24 weeks when obviously it can’t. LOL You do not even know your own position		doc246
That is why you look silly and have to swear		doc246
Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain		doc246
LOL Naw…you don’t.		doc246
Even if they are married it's the woman's decision still so this has no validity		doc247
If he is considered on ALL grounds then if he wants and abortion and she doesn't then his opinion counts and his vote for abortion could go ahead		doc247
You also called me a sissy		doc247
Sissy is actually considered homophobic by a lot of people		doc247
It's not an adjective		doc247
Brush up on your English language		doc247
It makes no difference if I said you're like a smelly tramp it's no nicer than saying you are a smelly tramp		doc247
I'm a fully fledged adult		doc247
It is not the truth it's your opinion		doc247
And I'm arrogant yet your feelings have to be the truth		doc247
Yay another list for me to make		doc247
Things you have said religiously to back your opinion		doc247
I can't be bothered to go through your previous debates but you have mentioned religion a lot more than this		doc247
a swear word is a word		doc247
It means nothing		doc247
Oh look another insult to me		doc247
And I'm not 'classy' it's not something I can aspire to with all my tattoos		doc247
I think a few re reads are in order here		doc247
Read their opinion and read mine		doc247
It's not even comparible		doc247
My education is nursing		doc247
I am going into midwifrey I can assure I need not much education on human biology and the facts of abortion		doc247
My opinion is what you think is heartless and cold		doc247
To many others it is acceptable and logic		doc247
Don't speak for the world		doc247
I'm not pro-abortion is should be considered as a last resort		doc247
And if the last resort is an abortion then I accept that		doc247
I don't champion killing		doc247
I don't tell anyone to abort and I don't abort myself		doc247
I just understand why people do		doc247
Biology isn't sexist again I study it		doc247
The context in which you describe things is sexist		doc247
The truth is what you perceive it to be		doc247
The truth is never what you think		doc247
If I had a child unmarried knew the father but we weren't a couple he would still have to pay child support		doc247
My fiance and I weren't married		doc247
He took responsibility		doc247
He admits he took the risk even though I was on contraception		doc247
Stop speaking for everyone not everyone shares your opinion		doc247
Not true		doc247
I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence		doc247
You champion killing so you don’t want to see the evidence		doc247
No you don't. You've posted 2 links from wikipedia that prove nothing and a link to a catholic website which I'm not even remotely going to listen to since it is there to create fear into becoming religious		doc247
I post genuine scientific evidence and have done throughout my debates		doc247
I use my evidence you use yours		doc247
Why does it matter		doc247
Not true		doc247
go educate yourself		doc247
Bugger		doc247
Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten		doc247
Because my opinion differs to yours I'm uneducated		doc247
I have educated myself and come to a conclusion		doc247
You have come to a conclusion I'm not going to tell you your opinion is wrong it's an opinion		doc247
That's the difference between you and I		doc247
I can accept that my opinion isn't right for everyone		doc247
You're a forcer		doc247
you think that everyone has to share your opinion or they're a bad person		doc247
And educate yourself on world language bugger is a common word among adults in England		doc247
So because I believe woman have the right to abortion I no longer have feelings		doc247
I feel empathy and sympathy		doc247
it's hardly mind boggling that a human being as emotion towards other peoples negative experiences		doc247
Stop word twisting		doc247
It's funny you'd repost my statement that abortion is a distressing thing to go through and then claim I want abortion to be seen positively		doc247
Consistence in the key in debating		doc247
Something you clearly don't have		doc247
I never denied this fact so I guess I'll just answer the first two questions		doc247
You can change your mind all you like it's no concern to me and I never claimed it to be		doc247
I'm allowed to change my mind		doc247
I probably won't on this topic though		doc247
I'm saying don't judge people on actions you have taken yourself		doc247
Again I'm aware of the consequences of abortion		doc247
Are you aware of the consequences of having a child you never wanted		doc247
Explain to me exactly when I have judged someone and acted arrogantly		doc247
Thanks for calling me perfect all the time		doc247
I don't believe it myself but you seem to for some odd reason		doc247
I protect my child and I will teach her the obvious stranger dangers e.c.t. But I'm not going to tell her to never have a friendship in case they fall out and she gets upset		doc247
I won't tell her to never have a relationship in case they break up		doc247
A lot of things hurt people you can't lock them up in a box and hope they never socialize		doc247
If my daughter was ever pregnant I'd help her		doc247
If she asks for the pros and cons I will tell her		doc247
If she asks me what to do I will say 'darling, whatever you feel is best for you'. Why		doc247
Because her happiness is the most important thing to me		doc247
stood by and did nothing in the holocaust because they were scared		doc247
And people did do something hence there was a war because people rose to fight the injustice		doc247
They didn't let Jews get gassed		doc247
Everyone participated		doc247
That's a wild claim to make		doc247
Most people in the world did not participate and a lot objected and acted upon that		doc247
And I'm arrogant		doc247
Stop calling me perfect		doc247
I'm blushing		doc247
Great		doc247
I have a wonderful child to		doc247
This means nothing to the debate subject		doc247
And being with same man isn't an accomplishment		doc247
It's a choice		doc247
You aborted but have the right to tell other woman they can't		doc247
Or that they're like Hitler		doc247
That they are murderers		doc247
Come off your high horse		doc247
Distraught about what		doc247
Having an abortion		doc247
derp		doc247
It is a horrible experience		doc247
My morals don't tell me it's wrong in all circumstances		doc247
Abortion is horrible		doc247
(The nursing and midwife studies might have resulted to this being true). It's not cold		doc247
uncompassionate and empty		doc247
You yourself said it's emotionless		doc247
How can it be empty then		doc247
I'm a bad person even though I assist in saving lives during pregnancy and child birth		doc247
Do you know how many unborn and born babies lives nurses and midwifes save		doc247
And because we choose abortion to be okay you think we are heartless murderers		doc247
Of course abortion is upsetting for a child		doc247
The word 'kid' kind of dictates a young age		doc247
I thought that was common knowledge		doc247
So they weren't children		doc247
Abortion of a sibling effects someone personally		doc247
Watching south park doesn't. Well I listed the names so you if you don't believe fact that is your ignorance		doc247
Of course I have problem with racism		doc247
No you think I am pro abortion		doc247
I am neutral if anything		doc247
I don't deceive myself into anything		doc247
you want to believe I am so you can preach		doc247
Even if I was it doesn't make my opinion wrong and yours right		doc247
I stand up for life especially those already born		doc247
I stand up for a woman's life and her choice to abort for a start		doc247
I No you are demeaning an opinion because it differs to yours		doc247
Because you don't like my opinion you assume I am an awful person		doc247
I had the same opinion as Hitler and Margaret who are racist		doc247
You are trying to warp my opinion and claim I am a bad person because of it		doc247
Your opinion is not right to everyone		doc247
Just because you believe something doesn't make it the truth		doc247
You just offend people by dismissing anything they say		doc247
You haven't exposed me		doc247
My opinion is the same and your debates don't make me even think about changing it		doc247
I never judged you on the basis of your abortion opinion		doc247
I point out what that are untruths They're not untruths		doc247
Just because you don't agree doesn't make them wrong		doc247
Not once have I quoted the Bible		doc247
Didn't think you could		doc247
Again your opinion is not fact		doc247
You think I am pro-abort it doesn't make it true		doc247
Great		doc247
I study work and have a 8 month old		doc247
I still find it takes no more than an extra 5 minutes to type most things correctly		doc247
I haven't lied once		doc247
You constantly lie		doc247
I pointed out every lie		doc247
All my scientific evidence I have posted with my debate		doc247
I don't want to count them but anyone who is reading can and will		doc247
I work in this field idiot		doc247
Nurse/midwife mean anything to you		doc247
It doesn't explain anything		doc247
I said I value people I just don't love them unless they are my family or friends		doc247
I can't pretend to have feelings for a stranger who means little to me		doc247
I certainly would never love you		doc247
Worldwide love is mostly a religious belief		doc247
Since I have no belief in religion I feel what I feel is right		doc247
Don't feel sorry for me I'm so happy and fulfilled with my life		doc247
Huge difference		doc247
I haven't told you your opinion on abortion is wrong		doc247
You tell me I am heartless a murderer		doc247
cold, ignorant		doc247
I accept my opinion isn't fact you can't do that		doc247
You place no actual evidence just your opinion		doc247
Your opinion is NOT fact		doc247
LOL Ever heard of reading		doc247
It will do your argument good		doc247
They feel pain at the beginning of the second trimester (around 12 weeks) and I think abortion should happen before that		doc247
Honestly		doc247
you liar, I said what about 30 times		doc247
24 week abortions are wrong		doc247
Yes it is 12-14 weeks		doc247
What the hell are you talking about		doc247
I said all along abortions shouldn't be allowed at 24 weeks		doc247
I know my position		doc247
I swear because I want to		doc247
I like swearing it's as much as the human language as any other word		doc247
The fetus feels pain at the beginning of the 2nd trimester		doc247
And yet, half the people here were talking about how it's the woman's choice ONLY		doc248
The argument people ALWAYS make are that it's		doc248
the woman's body.		doc248
Interesting		doc248
2) I actually can't agree with this		doc248
Rape is more iffy of course		doc248
but I don't think the child should have revenge taken out on them for being raped		doc248
The father who raped the women should suffer		doc248
not the child		doc248
I somewhat understand that point		doc248
but I don't think it makes anything right		doc248
I also think incest isn't much of a reason (Unless you're talking about the pedophillia related incest		doc248
) unless the women is AGAIN needing it for medical reasons		doc248
But consensual incest shouldn't equal death		doc248
I don't condone incest		doc248
but it's a lesser evil to other things		doc248
3) I can understand it if the baby has a deformity that WILL actually hurt them in the future		doc248
not much to argue I guess.		doc248
So a husband and wife that don't want children can never have sex		doc249
Contraceptives fail		doc249
So two people who don't want children can not get married - lack of sex is a slam dunk claim for divorce or annulment		doc249
You are required to fulfill your marital duties or your partner can divorce you in almost every state		doc249
In addition a healthy sex life is cited by almost all marriage councilors as vital to maintaining a healthy marriage		doc249
So how would a childless (by choice) couple be acting irresponsibly		doc249
In addition what is the difference to you		doc249
Either they are going to have sex and and abortion (if they get pregnant)		doc249
or they are going to abstain so as not to take the risk of getting pregnant if abortion is made illegal		doc249
Guess what - either way		doc249
no child is ever born		doc249
That couple has decided not to bring a child into this world under any circumstances		doc249
Personally I don't think they should have to go their whole lives without having sex.		doc249
They can have sex		doc250
but they must be prepared to deal with the result of it		doc250
Since when was sex the only thing that kept together a marriage		doc250
The purpose of marriage is to start a family		doc250
which includes supporting each other in BOTH good times and BAD		doc250
If you aren't trying to start a family then GTFO :) A childless couple isn't acting irresponsibly if they are prepared to take responsibility if they have sex.		doc250
Again a wonderful post animegirl		doc251
People especially women do not want to take responsiblity for their actions		doc251
it's always someone elses fault.		doc251
I support what 		doc252
but I would add this		doc252
when a child is concieved		doc252
there is nothing potential about it		doc252
It is already a living human being		doc252
And I would ask you to think about the rape and incest clause in your position		doc252
if you believe a human life starts at conception		doc252
how is death right for even a child of rape		doc252
If you walked into a nursery full of babies and the nurse told you that one out of the twentys mother was raped		doc252
would you be able to pick that child out		doc252
Life is life and although rape is a violent act		doc252
so is abortion		doc252
So rape is the first wrong		doc252
and then on top of that abortion is another		doc252
The woman can live with two crimes		doc252
That is the same as incest		doc252
If you are pro life that means you value ALL LIFE, not just some		doc252
If you are pro-choice and think that abortion should be legal even though you think its gruesome and wrong		doc252
then you are not pro-life		doc252
Being pro-life is being against abortion period		doc252
unless the woman is dying on the table		doc252
and then in most cases both can be saved.		doc252
Abortion in general is wrong in the sense of life being erased		doc253
It may be less so if it's for a valid reason like health		doc253
But I think that abortions made for more reasons than that is the result of selfishness usually		doc253
Abortion		doc254
When life becomes subjective		doc254
and a killing an option		doc254
Since when is it acceptable for people say that because it's not 'quite human' we can just do whatever the heck we want with it		doc254
The logic of something needing to PROVE that it has a right to live is just sick		doc254
Why is it that we get to define when it's okay to exterminate something		doc254
Why is it okay to kill an unborn child		doc254
period		doc254
It might be understandable in some situations		doc254
but it doesn't make the choice RIGHT		doc254
I LOVE how a person can go to jail for killing their household pets		doc254
but then it's suddenly perfectly okay to kill an unborn child because it hasn't met someone's standards of		doc254
It deserves to livee~		doc254
I can support a person's decision on the matter when it is completely necessary		doc254
but all the people who think abortion is all right and good is just sick :/		doc254
It is neither right nor wrong		doc255
I agree that the latest time to have an abortion should be reduced		doc255
In the UK it currently stands at 24 weeks		doc255
which is also an age a baby can survive		doc255
I think it's dependent on the situation of the pregnancy		doc255
If the child's going to be brought up into a life of poverty, abuse and just be bloody miserable well what kind of an existence is that		doc255
I also agree when a child has severe deformities or disabilities or an instance or rape (because of religion raped children as young as 7 have had to give birth which is no life for the baby or the mother). Even discounting these things it's still a woman's choice		doc255
At what point do you consider it to be killing a human life can I ask		doc255
Is it once an embryo has implanted or earlier (contraception)		doc255
My main concern with anti-abortionists is that they don't consider the problem of over-populating		doc255
If no one had an abortion could you imagine all the extra people there would be populating the planet		doc255
We would be in a massive state of poverty		doc255
much more drastic than we see now.		doc255
I am aware that your arguments were for someone else		doc256
I have a couple remarks about your arguments that I would like to share with you… What about the victims of rape		doc256
Should young girls risk their own lives for something they did not even consent to		doc256
Death penalty gives us the right to decide whether someone dies or lives		doc256
At war		doc256
soldiers constantly decide whether innocent enemy soldiers and civilians should live or die		doc256
human beings are given the right to kill others		doc256
You did not state any proof		doc256
You only quoted doctors who agree with you		doc256
I have one last question		doc256
Do the rights of an embryo outweigh the rights of woman?		doc256
Murder is a legal definition		doc257
It is the unlawful killing of another human being		doc257
Thus Abortion is not Murder		doc257
Shooting a burglar is		doc257
taking someone's life without permission		doc257
however that is not murder either		doc257
The right to bodily sovereignty should be absolute		doc257
What right is more basic that control over our own body		doc257
You have the right not have an operation		doc257
or medical care or drugs		doc257
You also have the right not to forcible donate blood		doc257
or organs, or risk your life to save another		doc257
All pregnancy carries risks to life and health		doc257
the fetus uses the mother's blood and organs		doc257
She has a right to stop their use		doc257
Can she abort in the 9th month		doc257
but she should have the right to evict		doc257
She has control of HER body		doc257
not the fetuses.		doc257
Take this hypothetical		doc258
A woman		doc258
her child and a doctor are out hiking in no mans land and they have an accident (a fall lets say). The child is injured		doc258
He needs a blood transfusion and the mother and child are the same type (the doctor is not). The doctor explains the risks to the mother - the child needs a lot of blood and he has no way to measure how much is being taken		doc258
there is a risk she will loose too much blood and die		doc258
She agrees He hooks her up		doc258
so she is supporting the childs life		doc258
After 10 minutes she is starting to feel lightheaded		doc258
and gets scared		doc258
She decides she doesn't want to do this anymore - she has 2 other children at home that need her		doc258
Does she have the right to unhook herself		doc258
The child will surely die		doc258
it's legal		doc258
and nobody has ever tried to make it illegal		doc258
Even after agreeing, and being hooked up		doc258
she can change her mind		doc258
So if a women gets pregnant		doc258
and the fetus is hooked up to her		doc258
why does she have to stay hooked up		doc258
At some point between her and the fetus the umbilical is part of her body		doc258
Does she not have the right to disconnect it if she feels she is not up to going through with it		doc258
Why would a women be legally required to keep her fetus alive by allowing it access to her body		doc258
but has no legal requirement that she keep her child alive after it is born (even if there is 0 risk to her life)		doc258
A women has a right to not have her body used by someone else.		doc258
Nothing is one sided		doc259
There is good and evil		doc259
but mostly gray		doc259
There is neutrality in everything . How can there is no neutrality		doc259
That's naive		doc259
I don't sit the fence		doc259
I say the radical opinions are idiotic		doc259
and it's foolish to not think they are		doc259
To say that you can kill a fetus at any stage in the pregnancy isn't right		doc259
but never allowing a women to do something specific to her own body also isn't right		doc259
simple		doc259
humans cannot judge humanity with our mere senses		doc259
The fact that we can't is the reason racism and fascism and sexism exists in the first place		doc259
You can't judge humanity by yourself and neither can I. Nobody can		doc259
But we're supposed to be beyond that sort of thing		doc259
Open-thought and technology accelerate us as a race		doc259
We're better then to take radical sides anymore		doc259
what constitutes a human being		doc259
Most would agree that a consciousness		doc259
a soul, constitutes a human being		doc259
We can't measure a consciousness without machines		doc259
If we can only measure humanity by measuring consciousness, then that means		doc259
until a fetus has a developed brain with measurable brainwaves		doc259
it is only a mass of soulless meat		doc259
It's a mass of meat until it exhibits brain waves for the same reason a severed arm is a mass of meat		doc259
just because it's made of human flesh and cells doesn't make it human		doc259
It has no consciousness		doc259
and therefore it has no soul		doc259
You cannot measure it's soul without measuring it's consciousness		doc259
so you cannot presume that it has a soul before it has a consciousness		doc259
but you can presume that is has a soul during and after it has a consciousness because you can measure it's consciousness		doc259
abortion is moral up until the fetus develops a consciousness		doc259
it is a human being and cannot be aborted		doc259
If it is aborted at that point, it is murder		doc259
To say that one radical side is right over the other is foolish		doc259
Both sides are illogical and presumptuous		doc259
Neutrality is the only logic and morality.		doc259
I said there is good and evil and mostly gray		doc260
don't mince my words		doc260
Rape is one of the few things that is unconditionally evil		doc260
But even rape has neutrality in it		doc260
Let's say you rape someone as evil as Hitler		doc260
a murderer of innocent people		doc260
Is that evil		doc260
Fighting evil with evil is not evil		doc260
it is neutral		doc260
There is only one truth		doc260
yes, but my point is that you don't know what that one truth is		doc260
Human perception is the only thing we can run on because it is the only way we can see things		doc260
I can't. Therefore, you cannot make assumptions of what the truth is by putting in place of it your opinions		doc260
My abortion belief is not opinionated in any way		doc260
and that's what separates me from you		doc260
It's a radical thing to say abortion is wrong under any circumstance because the idea that it is takes away freedom from certain people		doc260
Is taking away freedom right when people don't all share you ideas		doc260
there is a gray area in pedophilia you ding-dong		doc260
Have you no imagination		doc260
Here's a scenario		doc260
You are an adult		doc260
and you make great friends with a teenager		doc260
one day		doc260
you fall in love with him/her and they feel mutually back despite you being much older then them		doc260
Is that love wrong		doc260
Just because there is an age gap		doc260
Not necessarily		doc260
Not all pedophiles are evil perverts just because you think they are		doc260
What Hitler did WAS wrong		doc260
did I dispute that it wasn't		doc260
But in fact		doc260
it was gray in some areas		doc260
Because he saved Germany		doc260
He did more evil then good		doc260
but in the end, he still was some gray despite being a lot of evil		doc260
The 9/11 bombers were wrong to		doc260
but you have to realize		doc260
they were brought up in a third world country where they had nothing		doc260
where they starved to death whilst people like American's were getting hundreds of divorces every day		doc260
they killed people		doc260
but they suffered and died for their actions		doc260
Even in those acts, there was balance		doc260
despite being mostly evil		doc260
It's meant to be contradictory		doc260
I don't believe in either radical		doc260
I trust in the balance between the two which I explained		doc260
Why are you arguing as if I believe in both of them at the same time		doc260
I'm not pro-choice		doc260
I'm just on this side of the debate		doc260
The fact is that a fetus isn't human at a certain stage and completely human after a certain point		doc260
Just because we judge doesn't mean we know		doc260
I know facts when I speak of my abortion ideas		doc260
but I do not know facts when I make opinions of you		doc260
You're right		doc260
you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong		doc260
because I don't have opinions about this		doc260
I know facts about this		doc260
That's what I base my morality on		doc260
I don't care what the dictionary says		doc260
Use your own definition for a human being		doc260
What separates humans from most animals is that we have a self-aware consciousness		doc260
a soul		doc260
Some animals also do, but not all, but that doesn't mean we aren't still defined by our personality		doc260
consciousness, and soul		doc260
Just because something is alive doesn't mean it's alive like a human		doc260
A mushroom is alive		doc260
Is is it wrong to step on a mushroom		doc260
it has no consciousness		doc260
A severed chicken leg has living cells (for a time after being severed)		doc260
is it wrong to cook and eat it		doc260
It has no consciousness		doc260
What about a human finger		doc260
Is it by itself human because it has living cells (for a time)		doc260
To say it is human for that reason is illogical idiocy		doc260
humanity is measured by consciousness		doc260
You think the mentally retarded have no consciousness		doc260
They feel and think and have a soul		doc260
People in commas are sleeping		doc260
For a long time		doc260
They think and feel and have a soul		doc260
Vegetable people are not human		doc260
They brains are dead		doc260
They feel nothing		doc260
and have no soul		doc260
Only their organs are alive and their brains have no function except to keep their life processes going		doc260
They are vegetables		doc260
Are vegetables people		doc260
The person they were died with their brains		doc260
vegetable people are soulless piece of meat . I know that a soul inhabits a body when something has a consciousness		doc260
We have machines to tell this		doc260
What you do not have is a machine that can show that a soul inhabits a body before something has a consciousness		doc260
yes, I am God		doc260
I am a Pantheist		doc260
But that has nothing to do with this debate		doc260
If humanists mention souls, then apparently I'm not a humanist		doc260
Duh		doc260
I am not a butcher		doc260
but anyone can be a butcher if they want		doc260
The point is that masses of meat aren't human		doc260
dummy		doc260
Just because it's made of human cells doesn't make it human		doc260
Just because something is unconscious doesn't mean it doesn't have a consciousness		doc260
I am not being unscientific at all		doc260
nor grotesque and insane		doc260
You're insane for mincing my words together and taking everything I say in a manner that it does not mean		doc260
Abortion to purify races isn't right if that's the intent		doc260
But the act of the abortion at a stage before consciousness isn't wrong		doc260
the intent is wrong		doc260
Stem cell research is very beneficial for medical research		doc260
killing a conscious fetus and selling it's body parts is immoral and disgusting		doc260
That intent is wrong in some cases		doc260
but only the intent, not if the act of the abortion is before the fetus is conscious		doc260
the intent is wrong		doc260
but the act of aborting before the fetus is conscious isn't. I'm all over on what		doc260
Abortion is right when the fetus isn't a human		doc260
Once it's human		doc260
it's wrong		doc260
What's complicated about that		doc260
I know when a fetus is human		doc260
I can prove it		doc260
You can't prove that fetus is human before it has a consciousness		doc260
you do not need to provide a link		doc260
I gave it as an example of one of the extreme points		doc260
I've already said 3 or 4 times that I do not agree with either extreme point		doc260
I'm just on this side out of coincidence, and now because you're zealously pro-life		doc260
No, my comments are morally logical and make plenty of sense		doc260
What you thought my comments said by mincing the words together inside your mind is what makes no sense		doc260
What is wrong with you?		doc260
No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point		doc261
You forgot to listen to me again		doc261
The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil		doc261
either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety		doc261
Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic		doc261
or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being		doc261
Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right		doc261
because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it		doc261
The same goes for rape and murder		doc261
You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us		doc261
It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality		doc261
The human mind does		doc261
Evil		doc261
in a way, is in the eye of the beholder		doc261
But harm is not		doc261
If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it		doc261
Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them		doc261
The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality		doc261
What you need to understand is that harm is infallible		doc261
It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people		doc261
in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people		doc261
Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being		doc261
disabled or not		doc261
Harm is not subjective		doc261
It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive		doc261
It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance		doc261
Stop calling you names		doc261
You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying		doc261
My example is NOT sick		doc261
you are just a neophyte with no imagination		doc261
You think it's wrong		doc261
no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane		doc261
conscious, AND consenting teenager		doc261
I said teenager		doc261
not child, and there's a difference		doc261
Does your morality really only go so far as the law does		doc261
What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex		doc261
The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong		doc261
in fact, bullshit		doc261
Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place		doc261
A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has		doc261
including love		doc261
judgment, knowledge		doc261
awareness, coordination, everything		doc261
And if the teenager is a little young and doesn't have have all these things		doc261
they have almost all of these things		doc261
Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order		doc261
Consenting		doc261
mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries		doc261
Which brings me to a question for you		doc261
if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love		doc261
is that wrong		doc261
There's a 30 year difference		doc261
as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference		doc261
It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love		doc261
so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically		doc261
Do you not see the whole in that logic		doc261
A consenting		doc261
understanding person is a consenting		doc261
understanding person regardless of age		doc261
Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex		doc261
Some underage teenagers		doc261
on the other hand, are 		doc261
by mathematical probability		doc261
Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law		doc261
and if you have any compassion		doc261
you'll have an imagination and agree with me		doc261
Facts I know about abortion		doc261
Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves		doc261
and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy		doc261
That's a fact		doc261
Duh		doc261
I've said that about a dozen times to you		doc261
It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again		doc261
the fact is that a fetus		doc261
after a certain point, is a human being		doc261
It has a consciousness		doc261
Before that certain point		doc261
it has no consciousness		doc261
I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on		doc261
WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS		doc261
I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being		doc261
You think that it's always a human being		doc261
period		doc261
Give me proof that it is a human being		doc261
period, regardless of having a consciousness or not		doc261
I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat		doc261
you oblivious nincompoop		doc261
Yup, I'm God		doc261
Everything is God		doc261
You're God to		doc261
it is a fact that under certain circumstances		doc261
sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult		doc261
therefore it is not wrong		doc261
If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong		doc261
Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate		doc261
depending on their mentality		doc261
Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating		doc261
for them, cheating is not wrong		doc261
The same applies to lying and stealing		doc261
Example for lying		doc261
You're a Jew living in Germany		doc261
You look a little more German then Jewish		doc261
Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish		doc261
You lie and say you're not Jewish		doc261
You save your family and yourself		doc261
If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive		doc261
brainwashed fool		doc261
Have an imagination that factors in circumstance		doc261
Example of stealing		doc261
you're poor and starving		doc261
So is your family		doc261
A rich man leaves his car unlocked		doc261
His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car		doc261
You steal the money and leave the wallet		doc261
You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job		doc261
If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of Robin Hood . Child abuse is never wrong		doc261
because it's abuse		doc261
Abuse is to harm someone for no reason		doc261
Harm is infallible		doc261
Child abuse is never right		doc261
I do not defend evil		doc261
I defend only good		doc261
You are just a humongous idiot		doc261
In fact		doc261
YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied		doc261
if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family		doc261
and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life		doc261
Do you support these things		doc261
I hope no		doc261
In the case that yes		doc261
you are an evil piece of shit		doc261
You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people		doc261
In which case		doc261
you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in		doc261
I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't. You failed to understand what I said		doc261
Fool		doc261
People who are unconscious still have a consciousness		doc261
When you sleep		doc261
your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake		doc261
The same goes for comas		doc261
They have a consciousness		doc261
and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul		doc261
A fetus		doc261
on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy		doc261
To be unconscious		doc261
you must have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point		doc261
a fetus has no consciousness		doc261
therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul		doc261
UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS . Of course your baby would do that		doc261
it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still		doc261
It was human		doc261
It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized		doc261
UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS . No		doc261
YOU are sad		doc261
You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad		doc261
You're the coldest thing to ever exist		doc261
My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73		doc261
We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died		doc261
You despicable c-		doc261
I'll stop from saying that insult		doc261
But you are despicable		doc261
Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness		doc261
They are not comatose		doc261
they are not UNCONSCIOUS		doc261
They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER		doc261
I feel sad for you		doc261
being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right		doc261
To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct		doc261
How about we classify severed limbs as people to		doc261
then huh		doc261
Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy		doc261
Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being		doc261
I'd say screw you		doc261
I don't need to		doc261
Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are		doc261
A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness		doc261
PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS		doc261
you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!		doc261
I'm going to take for granted the notion that federal sanctioning of the taking of human life		doc262
be it in favor of whatever		doc262
greater good,		doc262
should not be tolerated		doc262
If anyone would like to contest this, let me know and I'll elaborate		doc262
While even the most ferocious of pro-borts openly admit that human life is scientifically defined as beginning at conception, others still insist that it is not		doc262
and some of their arguments should be taken into consideration		doc262
But while we're pontificating on the nature of human life		doc262
it is extremely irresponsible to allow potentially millions of human beings to die in the name of another's convenience		doc262
Better to err on the side of life.		doc262
I agree with you		doc263
We should not abort a fetus simply for the purpose that it will cause or bring convenience to us.		doc263
So are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it		doc264
Then why are you even against abortion		doc264
We are talking about a life here not just a fetus		doc264
I believe that everyone has a right to live		doc264
No fetus should pay the consequences because of a decision made by it's mother		doc264
In the year 2000		doc264
there were 1.3 million fetus that were killed and the same amount of families were waiting for children to adopt		doc264
If you are saying that nothing is wrong if a woman needs an abortion, the you are saying she can have repeat abortions		doc264
What if a woman who has unprotected sex and knows the consequences of her actions but later decides she wants an abortion		doc264
What is your opinion on that?		doc264
I'm very against abortion, but I'm not stupid		doc265
I know there are times where it is a necessity		doc265
I think it should ultimately stay legal		doc265
but should be a lot more restricted		doc265
I don't see anything good from a 25-year-old going in and getting an abortion because she just doesn't want the baby		doc265
Why should it matter to you if a person does that		doc265
That's awfully nosey and judgmental.		doc265
Murder is never a necessity		doc266
It is wrong no matter what the situation!		doc266
there is a a type of pregnancy that kills the mother AND the fetus unless its aborted		doc267
I pretty much agree that abortion is wrong otherwise though!!		doc267
There is a difference between murder and being legally killed because of issues relating to self defense or for the greater good of society.		doc268
Any Federal law on abortion is inherently illegal because the Federal government has no authority to regulate abortion		doc269
The States individually have the power to		doc269
I would be ecstatic if every State in the Union outlawed abortion		doc269
just like murder is outlawed.		doc269
Abortion isn't murder		doc270
A foetus is not a person in the meaningful sense of the word.		doc270
Isn't animal cruelty a crime		doc271
Animals are technically not people		doc271
So shouldn't it apply to unborn humans when one ends their life?		doc271
Ending a life isn't cruel		doc272
So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts		doc272
Oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you		doc272
These are the cruel methods stated again		doc272
METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY There are three abortion classifications—surgical abortion		doc272
medical abortion, and chemical abortion		doc272
They are defined as follows		doc272
Surgical abortion		doc272
These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure		doc272
Major types of surgical abortions include		doc272
Suction aspiration		doc272
This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb		doc272
The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle		doc272
Dilation and curettage (D&C;)		doc272
In this procedure		doc272
the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall		doc272
The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb		doc272
Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion)		doc272
Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old)		doc272
the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb		doc272
grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother		doc272
except for the head		doc272
The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull		doc272
The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out		doc272
The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way		doc272
Dilation and evacuation (D&E;)		doc272
This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart		doc272
The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth		doc272
Hysterotomy		doc272
Performed in the third trimester		doc272
this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby		doc272
The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse		doc272
Medical abortions		doc272
These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child		doc272
Common drugs used for medical abortions include		doc272
Mifepristone (RU-486)		doc272
Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby		doc272
The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug		doc272
misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb		doc272
Methotrexate		doc272
this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells		doc272
It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive		doc272
When the systems fail		doc272
the baby dies		doc272
Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb		doc272
Salt poisoning		doc272
This technique is used in the second and third trimester		doc272
The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb		doc272
The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby		doc272
The baby breathes in		doc272
swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning		doc272
dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions		doc272
Taking nearly an hour to die		doc272
the baby's skin is completely burned		doc272
turns red and deteriorates		doc272
The baby is in pain the entire time		doc272
The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby		doc272
Prostaglandins		doc272
Used during the second and third trimester		doc272
prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac		doc272
causing violent premature labor		doc272
During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving		doc272
Chemical abortions		doc272
These are abortions caused by drugs that		doc272
at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining		doc272
Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are		doc272
The Ortho-Evra® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins		doc272
which may inhibit ovulation		doc272
change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference		doc272
60 ed		doc272
Montvale		doc272
NJ		doc272
Thompson PDR		doc272
2402). The NuvaRing® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins		doc272
which may inhibit ovulation		doc272
change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR		doc272
2357). Depo-Provera® Contraceptive Injection		doc272
when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months		doc272
inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which		doc272
in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning		doc272
These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620). Plan B® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization		doc272
by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova		doc272
In addition		doc272
it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068		doc272
I believe Avasked said mistreatment counted as cruelty		doc273
Last I checked		doc273
mistreating someone includes murder and rape		doc273
Cruelty must involving hurting someone		doc273
physically or mentally		doc273
The fetus cannot think nor can feel.		doc273
No one kills a fetus because it isn't a conscious being		doc274
A paralyzed person is not in a literal parasitic relationship with another human being		doc274
If they are on life support, they are being kept alive by machines		doc274
They are not infringing on anyone's rights to bodily autonomy.		doc274
In the case of paralyzed or comatose patients, if a caretaker becomes unhappy with the situation		doc275
they are legally allowed to quit or otherwise cease their involvement		doc275
This is also not an issue of bodily autonomy		doc275
The only evidence I need for the parasitism of the fetus is the definition of the word parasite		doc275
an organism that lives inside another organism (its host) and siphons resources without reciprocation		doc275
The fetus uses the mother's body as its host		doc275
It depends solely on her for survival		doc275
no one else can step in and take her place if she is unhappy with the situation		doc275
If someone or something is using your body to survive, you should have a say in whether or not it is allowed to continue doing so		doc275
You should be permitted to decide what medical procedures you will undergo or forego		doc275
If you do not get to decide this, then your rights to bodily autonomy are being infringed upon		doc275
When the interests of the fetus and the mother collide		doc275
the mother should take precedence		doc275
more than a lack of consciousness in the fetus, is why I support abortion at the discretion of the mother and no one else.		doc275
You mentioned the term parasite so my question to you is does parasites posess the DNA which identifies us each as a human		doc276
And if the fetus is indeed a parasite then how come it belongs to the race of homo sapiens referred to as humans		doc276
To the extent of my knowledge i was taught that parasites feed from their host in return causing injury to the host which is completely the opposite in terms of the fetus		doc276
A fetus is formed from a sperm cell and a egg cell which identifies it as a developing human with developing organs		doc276
If the fetus is indeed a parasite then you are implying that all humans are parasites at the fetal stage and any doctors or scientist will prove you wrong		doc276
The body of a woman is not infringed upon because the fetus is formed from a natural process of reproduction which involves the reproduction of human organisms developing into human beings		doc276
Parasites are formed from foreign materials that enter the body but the fetus is formed from the cells of the human body itself which makes it a special function of the sex organs of the human body		doc276
Also that people who are caretakers of other people can denounce their rights to take care of that person who is paralyzed but what happens if that person signs a irrevocable power of attorney to stand for the person giving power of attorney		doc276
In this case it is a permanent legal contract between the appearer and the person recieving power		doc276
And even if this person recuses himself or herself from taking care of the paralyzed person wouldn't that person also depend on the help of doctors to survive		doc276
And what about newborns that are one day old		doc276
Don't they also feed from the body of the mother		doc276
Does that makes them a parasite?		doc276
I am just going to repeat what I said before in different terms because I am not sure how I can make it any more clear		doc277
A fetus makes its home inside the mother's body and leeches energy and nutrients from her		doc277
which is very taxing on her body		doc277
The fetus does not contribute anything in return		doc277
without a doubt, the definition of a parasitic relationship		doc277
I don't know how you can interpret this relationship as the 'opposite' of what I stated as that would entail the mother leeching from the fetus without contributing anything in return		doc277
The bodily autonomy of the woman is infringed upon if she doesn't want the fetus to continue using her as a host and she is forbidden from seeking an abortion		doc277
Back to the patient		doc277
I admit that I am unfamiliar with legal complications like that		doc277
it still seems that everyone involved has a way of disentangling themselves from a situation of caring for a paralyzed person		doc277
The person with power of attorney can recuse		doc277
as and doctors voluntarily take care of patients because it is their job		doc277
If they didn't like it, they could quit or transfer		doc277
No matter what kind of bizarre hypothetical one can pose with a paralyzed person		doc277
it is still not an issue of the caretakers' rights to bodily autonomy being challenged		doc277
If you have a newborn baby and a mother who does not want to take care of that newborn baby, then the solution is simple		doc277
she gives up her rights to the baby and someone else takes care of it		doc277
It still needs her permission to be able to use her body for survival		doc277
but in this case, if she chooses not to grant it		doc277
it can survive in other ways		doc277
This is not the case with an inviable fetus.		doc277
How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus		doc278
You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens		doc278
A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury		doc278
There is no proof of that in a fetus		doc278
For a parasitic relationship		doc278
those elements of science have to exist		doc278
But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder		doc278
Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well		doc278
If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence		doc278
And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion		doc278
then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.		doc278
When she is prevented from dealing with her body as she sees fit		doc279
her rights to her own body are being infringed upon		doc279
This is self-evident and if you disagree you are going to have to explain yourself		doc279
There is no such thing as a 'human kingdom'. Humans are as much a part of the animal kingdom as cats		doc279
chimps, and mice		doc279
Do not assume I don't understand what you are trying to say		doc279
It just irrelevant		doc279
Regardless of species, the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them		doc279
this is a parasitic relationship		doc279
one organism leeches from another without returning anything		doc279
Some definitions include the stipulation of separate species		doc279
you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship		doc279
It only takes		doc279
it does not return		doc279
The claim that pregnancy causes no injury to the woman leads me to believe you have never even spoken to a pregnant woman		doc279
Pregnancy is extremely taxing on the mother's body		doc279
even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active		doc279
It often leads to malnutrition		doc279
anemia, or high blood pressure, and even when it doesn't do any of these things		doc279
it is still exhausting		doc279
painful, and their bodies will never be the same		doc279
This is technically injury to the woman		doc279
even though in some cases it may be minor		doc279
and is completely natural		doc279
If a woman were to be forced to endure a pregnancy based on what someone else think she should do with her body, I am sure the mental toll would also be enormous		doc279
You are studying law and you are trying to say abortion is legally murder		doc279
A fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it		doc279
The fetus having possession of the mother's DNA has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is murder		doc279
Your skin cells have your DNA but you are not committing murder when you scratch yourself		doc279
This point is also of subjective importance		doc279
don't assume that what matters to you is what matters to everyone		doc279
Even if I did consider a fetus to be a human life, I still maintain that the mother's rights override the rights of the fetus		doc279
I would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they didn't want		doc279
effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else's whims		doc279
This sounds like a nightmare		doc279
The government has no right to tell you or any other citizen what medical procedures they must undergo or what medical procedures they may not undergo		doc279
The reason the mother is and should be culpable is that		doc279
at that point, the child can depend on someone else for life		doc279
so if she does not want the responsibility		doc279
she is able to someone who will care for the child		doc279
Before the fetus is viable		doc279
it cannot depend on anyone else for life		doc279
so if she does not want the responsibility		doc279
she is unable to find anyone else who will finish the pregnancy for her		doc279
Abortion is currently the only option for women who do not want to remain pregnant		doc279
if there were some way to remove the fetus and put it in the body of a willing surrogate		doc279
Since this is nonsense		doc279
I am going to assume you mean 'adoption' instead of 'abortion'. This does not change a single thing about my argument		doc279
at this point		doc279
the child can depend on someone but its biological mother for survival		doc279
so abortion is not necessary if the biological mother no longer wants to care for it.- In addition to my previous point		doc279
I would like to pose a hypothetical situation		doc279
Someone has a child		doc279
When their child is 10 years old		doc279
he becomes gravely ill		doc279
Only an organ transplant will save him		doc279
the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents		doc279
For whatever reason		doc279
the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs		doc279
Should the government get involved and force one of the parents to give the child an organ		doc279
under threat of punishment		doc279
If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation		doc279
Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list		doc279
the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate		doc279
and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.		doc279
You do not need to imply that I am so stupid as to not realize a fetus and mother are not the same species		doc280
I have already pointed out that some definitions of parasitism include a stipulation about species		doc280
The distillation of the relationship		doc280
however, as I have explained I don't know how many times		doc280
is that one organism takes without returning and one organism gives involuntarily without receiving		doc280
This exactly describes the relationship between both a mother and a fetus and a parasite and its host		doc280
For the sake of not being stuck on this semantic point forever		doc280
I will stop using the term 'parasitic relationship' and use the phrase 'a relationship in which the fetus siphons resources without contribution and the mother gives involuntarily and may very well suffer ill consequences of varying severity due to the presence of the fetus'. I am not familiar with the abortion issue in other countries and thus my arguments are concerning abortion in America only		doc280
In America		doc280
the Supreme Court does not consider abortion to be murder		doc280
This is evidence by the fact that doctors who perform abortion in legal states are not arrested and charged with murder		doc280
and unless I am mistaken		doc280
the women who receive abortions		doc280
legal or not, are not arrested and charged with murder either		doc280
It doesn't matter to me whether or not abortion was first legalized because of a lie or that one of the involved parties was later arrested for anything		doc280
What matters to me is that abortion is a right women should have or continue to have		doc280
even if they became pregnant during consensual sex		doc280
My feelings on this are not based on any legal precedent		doc280
It ruled the fetus is alive		doc280
Not that it is equal to a human life		doc280
Bacteria		doc280
plants, and chickens are alive but they are not human lives		doc280
Do you understand the difference		doc280
If the Supreme Court had ruled that fetuses are not just alive but also human lives, they would have no choice but to rule abortion as murder		doc280
and neither can a fetus if you abort it.		doc280
I did not say this at all and I am baffled as to how you came to this conclusion		doc281
I have given my reasons why the fetus-mother relationship could be defined as parasitic in literally every post since the issue came up		doc281
If you are going to blatantly ignore them, I am not going to rephrase them again		doc281
Abortion is legal		doc281
Murder is not legal		doc281
Therefor		doc281
legally, abortion cannot be murder		doc281
I do not agree with this precedent unless the fetus has passed the threshold of viability		doc281
abortion is still not murder and yes		doc281
it should be a right to women		doc281
I am not trying to claim that fetuses are dead		doc281
so I am not sure why you brought that up		doc281
I realize that they are alive		doc281
I just do not put that expression of life on the same level of the expression of life you see in actual conscious human beings		doc281
Animals are alive but they are not considered human		doc281
That was kind of my point		doc281
Being composed of living tissue does not automatically mean you are a human and you get all the rights that come along with that		doc281
Don't ignore the part of the sentence that is inconvenient to you		doc281
An aborted fetus is equally incapable of developing into a human.		doc281
Hey, if women want an abortion they should be allowed,it's their baby		doc282
YOU DON'T SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH KILLING AN INNOCENT LIFE????		doc283
IF YOU DON'T YOU NEED TO GO GET SOME HELP!!		doc283
WHAT IF YOUR PARENTS DID THAT TO YOU???		doc283
Never talk in caps		doc284
go back to Elementary School.] Don't scratch yourself then		doc284
It kills the lives of innocent skin cells		doc284
A fetus is also just cells		doc284
It is also not human yet		doc284
[WHAT IF YOUR PARENTS DID THAT TO YOU???] He wouldn't be here		doc284
But he also wouldn't have lost anything		doc284
because nothing he had ever done has happened.		doc284
It is a woman's choice wither or not to have a baby		doc285
If someone doesn't want to then they don't have to, they aren't killing a human because it hasn't been born yet		doc285
It is better not to have a baby than to have it and not want it.		doc285
It may be the Woman's choice but		doc286
it IS murder there is no covering that up it is proven		doc286
If they don't want it give it up for adoption things are so much easier now-a-days.		doc286
It's not murder		doc287
proven		doc287
Murder is ending a human life		doc287
A fetus is not human yet		doc287
they could give it to an orphanage		doc287
which are already crowded enough as it is.		doc287
Abortion is fine if a woman does not want to keep the baby		doc288
It's her body		doc288
She is the one experiencing the pregnancy		doc288
Some say the life inside the woman is not hers		doc288
Life is sacred		doc288
Therefore she has no right to abort it		doc288
But the life is inside her body		doc288
life is far from sacred		doc288
Everyday		doc288
about 25,000 humans die from hunger		doc288
Every day		doc288
But nobody really cares		doc288
A fetus is not even a fully formed human		doc288
In the early stages especially		doc288
it is just a bunch of cells		doc288
Abortion is something that shouldn't be trivialized		doc288
But undoubtedly		doc288
for the right reasons, there is no moral issue here at all.		doc288
I am 100% pro-abortion for reasons outlined in my previous argument		doc289
I have not been disputed and therefore the winning position is pro-choice		doc289
Clicking a button to raise a point counter is a shoddy voting method that by no means reflects winning vs losing positions		doc289
To summarize		doc289
only when you view reincarnation as untrue does abortion mean death		doc289
Otherwise it means denying one of many chances to be born		doc289
I will support the pro-reincarnation standpoint (prove it wrong I dare you) and say that stopping a rape-baby or a 15 year old mother- baby from having a real chance at life is a crime against humanity perpetrated by fundamental extremists who have nothing better to do than bitch about the lifestyles of others		doc289
-If you care about human life so much		doc289
protest the war in iraq you ignorant tools spouting off the memes your parents instilled		doc289
-A fetus doesn't have the same rights that a fully developed human does		doc289
but that doesn't stop religious fanatics and		doc289
humanists		doc289
from bitching a thousand times louder when it involves a being only arguably alive		doc289
-If you view anything with a heart as important		doc289
why do you enslave and beat and choke collar and shock collar your pets YOU HYPOCRITICAL MORONS		doc289
-If every pro-life woman was raped and impregnated		doc289
the female pro-life support would dwindle		doc289
Dispute me.		doc289
This whole 'pro-life' bullshit is mostly coming from religious fanatics who have been born and raised to repress women		doc290
They never had a chance to form their own independent thoughts because their parents shoved their opinions down their throats when they were too young to understand what was going on		doc290
I don't care what gender you are		doc290
what I do with my body is none of your business		doc290
Stop trying to take away my common human rights and actually do something useful		doc290
like EDUCATING OUR SEXUALLY-ACTIVE YOUTH!		doc290
AGREED WITH ARY11 with everything!!!!!!!		doc291
Educating our sexually active youth is vital		doc291
Perhaps if we actually took the time to properly discuss the consequences of having un-safe sex		doc291
then abortion wouldn't even have to be an issue		doc291
nonetheless		doc291
regardless of the consequence the decision is still the ONE person's. Which is the woman deciding to have/not have the abortion.		doc291
There is a reason why they sides are called Pro-life vs Pro-Choice		doc292
Very few (if any) are for abortion		doc292
I happen to be one of them		doc292
however, I am for a woman's right to chose		doc292
The only argument that Pro-life people have to take away the right of other is based off of their own self-righteousness.		doc292
Of course I do not agree with abortion		doc293
It is murder		doc293
Did you know there is a law that you go to jail if you hurt a lady that makes her loose her baby		doc293
but not to kill it on purpose in abortion		doc293
Now does that make sense?		doc293
HELL NO		doc294
IF YOU WERE GROWN ENOUGH TO SPREAD YOUR FUCKING LEGS THEN YOU ARE GROWN ENOUGH TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF YOUR FUCKING KID		doc294
YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS!!!		doc294
KILLING A INNOCENT BABY ISN'T GONNA JUST GO AWAY LIKE A RAINY DAY!!!		doc294
YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE GUILT FOREVER!!!!!!!		doc294
gt		doc295
That is soo true living with the guilt forever know you murder you child it would have been even better if the murder hadn't been born.		doc295
Abortion is WRONG		doc296
God created that person for a reason		doc296
If your not ready to raise a kid then put it up for adoption so it can be with a good family		doc296
Dont murder it		doc296
Its wrong		doc296
It has a life		doc296
If you can have sex then you should be ready for the consequences tht come with it!		doc296
How many times is this topic going to be posted		doc297
The same asshole Materialists come on here and spread their filth		doc297
Abortion IS murder people there is no denying that and you can't prove its not		doc297
I stand by that.		doc297
Abortion is just awful because can a woman just sit there and let the baby get killed when its made of her flesh and the bone of her bone thats just so wrong the you would kill your own child raped or not raped.		doc298
Its Bad To Murder Babies		doc299
In my opinion it is wrong		doc300
because you kill a baby		doc300
even if he was not born		doc300
We have to save lives		doc300
but not to kill them		doc300
it is inmoral according to philosophy		doc300
In addition		doc300
it harms to the health of woman		doc300
Even in future this woman cannot have any babies.		doc300
you may not know it but a babies heart starts beatin 18 days after conception and you usually dont know until after then that your pregnant so therefore you are killing a child when you get an abortion unless the outcome is going to be you and the child dying then there is no point whatsoever in killing your child		doc301
i think that if you get pregnent and dont want to keep the child the right thing to do would be to give it to a baren couple whom long for children		doc301
It's a blastula		doc301
then embryo		doc301
then foetus		doc301
It is never a child		doc301
for child refers to the immature birthed		doc301
A baby refers to the recently birthed		doc301
If a mother wants to get pregnant and then abort it is her right to do so		doc301
It is none of your business to tell her what she may do with her body		doc301
especially when it is such an intimate and emotional decision.		doc301
In your point of view it is okey to kill somebody just like you		doc302
Even though it is absolutely wrong		doc302
It is unnormal and immoral to kill a baby.		doc302
Even though this argument contained a segment that invoked religion, I do respect it for supplying more than an endless stream of Bible verses and claims about what God wants or doesn't want		doc303
1. If I somehow find myself in a situation where my survival relies on using someone else's body as a host, then I absolutely support their right to terminate that dependency at the expense of my life		doc303
especially if I an incapable of thought or choice		doc303
This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not		doc303
the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing		doc303
whether or not that living thing is a human		doc303
If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors		doc303
2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex		doc303
the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term		doc303
in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment		doc303
3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics		doc303
as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data		doc303
even if they are true		doc303
it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions		doc303
alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal		doc303
abortion could be safer		doc303
and pregnant women could be better educated and supported before and after they make the choice to continue their pregnancy or not		doc303
But there are more than sob stories for post-abortion women		doc303
there are plenty of women who were grateful for the choice and never looked back.		doc303
In addition, I want to add that many childern have been killed because of abortion		doc304
Can you imagina what kind of people they could have been if they were not killed		doc304
What if you had gave them a chance to live		doc304
because they have this right to live		doc304
And just imagine how many great people and masterminds have been killed even before their birth?		doc304
If they had chance to live, maybe these people would have made our world better!		doc304
If the mother is not ready for a child it'll be hard for her to take care of it		doc305
If you are taken care of by a mother that is unprepared the chances are life is going to be tough, making it difficult to become a genius.		doc305
A fetus does not have the right to life as long as it is nothing more than a product of its mother and father		doc306
When that fetus begins to respond to its environment in a way that environmentally expresses its genes to be different than that of what is found in the mother and the father		doc306
it is entitled to life		doc306
Most scientists believe this occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy		doc306
which isn't the best time to have an abortion anyways		doc306
But before the fetus begins to respond to its environment like I mentioned		doc306
it is not an individual		doc306
It has no characteristics different than what the mother and the father have or have at least passed onto it		doc306
Something that is not an individual is not entitled to those rights		doc306
abortion is typically always a tough decision for every woman		doc306
Many find it to not be the most moral of decisions		doc306
but it is usually found to be the right decision.		doc306
These little unborn infants are also living things as we are and when women kill them		doc307
it is the almost the same as killing an adult or a child		doc307
I can say that God is creator of everything and when we kill unborn babies we destroy his creations		doc307
According to the wordds of Nattyc		doc307
Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby		doc307
and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby		doc307
confused because they don't want to be pregnant		doc307
and evil because they kill children		doc307
they also don't trust god and what he provides.		doc307
abortion is a selfigh decision and I absolutely agree with this statement		doc307
We must think about other people		doc307
especially about the closet ones		doc307
At the time of pregnancy the unborn baby of the wonam is the closest person to her		doc307
Women have to appreciaete and save it.		doc307
Abortion is a form of murder and demeans the value of human life		doc308
2.Other birth control is readily available		doc308
abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control		doc308
3.The societal contributions of a potentially valuable human being are wiped out		doc308
4.Women who have abortions often suffer major psychological damage from the experience along with		doc308
in some cases, the father of the child		doc308
5.The abortion decision is often made by minors or young adults		doc308
who don't have the maturity and life experiences to make good decisions		doc308
6.Abortion exposes women to various health risks and the danger of losing fertility		doc308
7.Abortion is against doctors' Hippocratic Oath that is historically taken by doctors swearing to practice medicine ethically.		doc308
what about abortion for woman who get raped		doc309
Or if they know the pregnancy is going to be difficult and therefore can lead to death of the baby and/or the mother		doc309
Or what if the child is born and there is so many difficulties that the child will not be able to succeed in life?		doc309
I guess the implication is that by legalizing abortion		doc310
would that encourage in youths a perception that it is therefore okay to have sex since there is always a 'back-up plan' (to simply abort the child)?		doc310
To be honest		doc311
abortion is murder		doc311
as admitted by many scientists		doc311
the most common abortion is resulting from people being careless and stupid		doc311
not rape		doc311
Even in the case of rape, abortion should not be done		doc311
Even if the fetus is not alive, why terminate it		doc311
What if the baby would have been born and developed in to a legendary scientist with an IQ of 200		doc311
My friend's mother was advised to abort her unborn child because it was very likely the baby would be born with a defect		doc311
She refused		doc311
and he was born without any defects and actually is a gifted learner in very advanced classes		doc311
So by your logic		doc311
if someone runs into your yard and plants an oak tree seed		doc311
you should take it out of the ground and dispose of it because it was a mistake		doc311
Ridiculous		doc311
A better analogy with your seed metaphor would be if someone dug a little hole in the middle of your house and planted a seed for a tree		doc312
At first it didn't matter		doc312
but then the tree started to grow and take up your whole house		doc312
You couldn't get around		doc312
there were birds flying around your house that laid nests in the tree		doc312
it was awful		doc312
So you decided to remove the tree		doc312
it is your property after all		doc312
But there is a group of people who worship a book that tells them that removing trees from the ground is immoral and should never be done under any circumstances		doc312
They are so influential that it is illegal for you to remove the tree		doc312
"What am I supposed to do?		doc312
Just wait until the tree is grown after a year		doc312
and then you can give it up for someone else to care of		doc312
"This isn't fair		doc312
"I shouldn't have to have something growing in my house that I don't want"		doc312
I think abortion should be banned because Abortion eliminates the potential societal contributions of a future human being		doc313
"After tens of millions of [abortion] 'procedures'		doc313
has America lost anything		doc313
Another Edison		doc313
A Gershwin		doc313
A Babe Ruth		doc313
A Duke Ellington		doc313
… As it is, we will never know what abortion has cost us all.		doc313
I think if you get raped and you get pregnant		doc314
That is the only excuse to get an abortion		doc314
firstly, i believe abortions is almost never the right choice		doc315
maybe in 00.01% of cases it can be allowed		doc315
but rarely		doc315
but i believe people should have the choice to do it or not		doc315
i may not agree with it in many cases		doc315
but my beliefs and morals shouldn't effect someone else's		doc315
as i may not know the full story.		doc315
Back alley		doc316
abortions would increase if it were made illegal		doc316
leading to increased risk of young women dying or becoming sterile		doc316
2.It's better for society to have babies aborted than have them be brought up poor and neglected		doc316
where not only will the child suffer but society when that child develops a higher attraction to crime		doc316
welfare, etc		doc316
3.It is a more viable option for those who are unable to shoulder the financial burden and responsibility of raising a child on their own		doc316
4.Giving up a child for adoption can be just as emotionally damaging as having an abortion		doc316
5.Abortion is not murder because it is performed before a fetus has developed into a human person.		doc316
the very fact that abortion has been put it shows that there is a need for it		doc317
the various circumstances of the individuals requiring abortion differs greatly		doc317
a young couple having made a mistake		doc317
a couple with financial problems and cannot cope with another child		doc317
rape victims, the list goes on		doc317
while there are circumstances when one does not deserve to have an abortion		doc317
but the child that is born will suffer the consequences of its parents mistakes		doc317
Banning abortion is like imposing the death sentence on youths using drugs.		doc317
So are ing it's okay to kill something that could potentionally be someone just like you		doc318
I can see that it is your point of view		doc318
but even though child cannot be killed		doc318
It is unnormal and immoral.		doc318
Aside from religious views, there are more ways to look at abortion		doc319
By any means		doc319
abortion should never be encouraged because it is		doc319
indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life		doc319
save for our own		doc319
However, there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable		doc319
First and foremost		doc319
Abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy - a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years		doc319
That is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done		doc319
If they had had sex, then it's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it		doc319
Thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems		doc319
however, there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother's health at risk		doc319
If the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer, high blood pressure		doc319
it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy		doc319
For if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother		doc319
aren't we killing another life as well		doc319
it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take		doc319
but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother's life is at risk.		doc319
well, it is a bad decision to have abortion		doc320
even if you had an emotional past or some effect that leads to having abortion		doc320
honestly the baby did not do anything to you		doc320
what happened to you should not have killed the baby		doc320
you call yourself human		doc320
taking a life is nothing to go on living or smiling about		doc320
and then how could you even begin to wake up everyday knowing you took your own baby's life		doc320
it is cruel and such an evil thing to do		doc320
and i am pretty sure its not our body but in soul were all connected and we never said it was ours to begin with		doc320
your babies are human and deserved to be loved also		doc320
how will they ever know if you end their lives.		doc320
Funny, I would say since the baby hasn't done anything to you		doc321
you shouldn't subjugate it to a life of loneliness and misery		doc321
There are already enough unloved orphans in the world		doc321
why bring in another		doc321
If I had to choose, I would rather my life be ended as a fetus so I can go find another body to live in		doc321
perhaps one with a mother whom would want me for a reason greater than guilt		doc321
A reason like love .		doc321
So because I disagree with you on capitalism		doc322
you're going to stalk and harass me now		doc322
That is utterly pathetic		doc322
Most children in the adoption system don't get adopted		doc322
Hmm, wow that was quick		doc322
I guess there just wasn't any real substance to your post		doc322
So no one can love an adopted child		doc323
We have enough children that are not being taken up in homes and families		doc323
and you just want to exacerbate this.		doc323
A couple critical points		doc324
This Is not equal to this uploads/1/foetus.jpg Or this A baby is not a foetus or an embryo		doc324
The words are not interchangeable		doc324
When a woman is pregnant		doc324
a baby isn't sitting in her womb for nine months already developed		doc324
Calling it a baby is a way to emotionally hijack the topic		doc324
It's like calling hamburgers		doc324
puppies		doc324
in order to make us vegetarians		doc324
Second point		doc324
A foetus is not a life		doc324
It hasn't lived in the outside world yet and formed an identity.		doc324
a spider is not human life therefore it is not as precious for it does not have a soul and i for one usually don't kill spiders unless they are of harm		doc325
Nothing has a soul		doc325
We simply live		doc325
A spider has as much life as you and I. We consider ourselves more precious because of our minds		doc325
and a foetus has no mind.		doc325
BS foetuses have brains and central nervous systems		doc326
they can feel pain and even hear sounds outside of the womb		doc326
A brain is not a mind		doc327
They are separate		doc327
A mind is a brain with identity		doc327
They respond to sounds and stimuli		doc327
they are not really aware		doc327
How could they be aware as we think of it when an infant is only starting to develop this aspect of mind?		doc327
Some evidence please		doc328
Otherwise LOL It is an obvious extrapolation from known facts		doc328
Taxis does not require a mind		doc328
as observed in simple animals like fruit flies		doc328
Brains themselves are complicated entities		doc328
which in Humans mature at around 18 to 23 years		doc328
Infant brains are still critically forming		doc328
hence why they are so dependent upon us and only start learning language after at least the first year and motor function is under critical development		doc328
Why would you assume that an infant has a fully aware mind at birth		doc328
much less the weeks before birth all the way down to the first twelve weeks of pregnancy?		doc328
how can you compare a spider to a human life		doc329
a spider is not creative		doc329
a spider is not capable of love or emotion		doc329
a spider is not very productive		doc329
and a spider is an insect not a human		doc329
plus a fudus if you want to call it that does have a mind or else it would not be able to curl its toes and suck it's thumb nor would it be able to grow!		doc329
Both are equally alive		doc330
Both have their own respective niches		doc330
can you make your own webbing		doc330
or inject venom		doc330
You're arguing that a spider is not a human		doc330
not that a spider is less alive than A foetus has a brain		doc330
but it has no identity yet		doc330
A foetus is incomplete		doc330
like an empty shell.		doc330
I do not believe in abortion		doc331
You are killing a living breathing human being		doc331
I understand why certain people might want to get an abortion		doc331
i.e they were raped or can't afford to take care of it		doc331
but if that's the case then just give the child to someone else.		doc331
This is a human being		doc332
images/amazing_human_being_01.jpg This is a foetus		doc332
foetusREX010606_228x188.jpg It has no mind		doc332
It has no awareness		doc332
It is a burden to someone else		doc332
This is why abortion exists.		doc332
What if somebody right now was deciding whether or not to let you live or die		doc333
It would not matter because I would not exist yet to object		doc333
A foetus has no identity		doc333
It isn't aware of what is happening.		doc333
The true cause of this 'burden' is the irresponsibilty of idiots which lead to elective abortion		doc334
The second major issue I have with your distastefully anti human post is that you think a human being is only a human being after it has been born		doc334
that is scientifically speaking utter garbage		doc334
revealing a lack of understanding about human biology		doc334
Abortion is murder		doc334
Pure and simple		doc334
I am no christian incidently		doc334
my premise is entirely logical.		doc334
How fascinating Yes personal responsibility is a terrible thing		doc335
something we should never expect of anyone		doc335
How subjectively arbitrary		doc335
you think your opinion here gives weight to your argument		doc335
Interesting		doc335
Semantics		doc335
depends which nation you live in		doc335
OK Abortion is killing		doc335
pure and simple		doc335
Have I seen a foetus		doc335
What a seemingly stupid question		doc335
what relevance is that		doc335
Please elucidate.		doc335
You keep throwing around that word		doc336
unique		doc336
as if it is a prerequisite to life that it have a unique genome		doc336
Bananas are asexually propagated		doc336
they bear no seeds		doc336
so they share the same genome for all members of a cultivar		doc336
I think you have missed my basic point		doc336
A human foetus is nothing like a fruit or a banana		doc336
so your comparisons are utterly absurd.		doc336
Both are unfeeling		doc337
Both are unaware of existence		doc337
Both are composed of cells		doc337
Both have metabolism		doc337
Both are offspring of a parent (a fruit is cells around seeds). Nonsense the foetus has a central nervous system fruit do not		doc337
Secondly one is animal the other is plant		doc337
I think you need some biology lessons lol.		doc337
Plants have systems which are alike our nervous system		doc338
merely simpler and with different purpose		doc338
I repeat		doc338
Plants do not have central nervous systems		doc338
foetuses do		doc338
Brain waves have been recorded by EEG (electro- encephalograph) in the human embryo 40 days after fertilisation human-development#first		doc338
So in a historical sense, yes, your testes have cells which are animals (animals need not be multicellular) but which are evolved to be genetically identical and inter-dependent		doc339
O dear		doc339
You could argue that a human being is a composite of billions of animals working together		doc339
How does that prove that a foetus is no more special than a Plum		doc339
A foetus is human		doc339
a Plum is not		doc339
That is the crux		doc339
which you do not grokk		doc339
I'm pro life, but this is a free country		doc340
Abortion is the woman's right		doc340
as much has I disagree with it		doc340
The only time I agree with it		doc340
is if the woman's life is in severe danger from the pregnancy		doc340
I digress		doc340
A heavy handed government controlling these sorts of rights doesn't sit well with me.		doc340
False		doc341
While society's definition of Pro-life is actually a purely anti-abortion stance		doc341
I follow a more traditional understanding of the definition of Pro-life		doc341
which is I am for whatever is more conducive to saving human life.Also		doc341
did you even read my comment		doc341
I said I personally believe that it should only happen if it is to save the mother's life		doc341
people should be free to get abortions if they want too		doc341
That's the beauty of choice		doc341
Without the option to do wrong		doc341
"right		doc341
is meaningless.		doc341
Regardless of a biased opinion of whether abortion is 'shameful' or not, abortion should absolutely be legal		doc342
A woman has rights to her own body		doc342
as do men to their own		doc342
It is arguable that it is 'killing' or 'murdering' a creature		doc342
but you cannot end something that hasn't ever been started		doc342
Women's rights to their very own bodies should not be violated because of less open minds		doc342
It should never be a question that women are unaffected by the choices they make every day		doc342
I conclude with		doc342
it is only the choice of the maker of the decision		doc342
and that decision is none other than the person that is in direct control of it		doc342
especially if it directly effects the health of a one persons body.		doc342
I agree with you until		doc343
The fetus being killed most certainly has been started		doc343
It is a human being		doc343
It may not have any great capacity for intelligent thoughts or feelings		doc343
but neither do newborns		doc343
Is it OK to kill them too		doc343
I will agree with you other point that women (and men) should be able to do whatever it is they want to their own bodies		doc343
But in the case of abortion		doc343
this right does not apply because it does not only pertain to the woman's body		doc343
but the body of another human being still attached to her		doc343
No one should have the right to kill innocent people.		doc343
Bullshit		doc344
Try pricking a newborn with a needle and see if it has feelings		doc344
won't you		doc344
you're wrong here		doc344
The fetus is considered a parasite		doc344
According to the OED		doc344
the scientific definition of a parasite is		doc344
An animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism (technically called its host) and draws its nutriment directly from it		doc344
Also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others		doc344
but not at their expense (strictly called commensal or symbiotic)		doc344
also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance		doc344
as the cuckoo, the skua-gull, etc.		doc344
(Emphasis my own) All a woman does to continue with the pregnancy is to allow the fetus to live within her and draw nutrients from her		doc344
Conversely		doc344
when a woman chooses to abort the fetus		doc344
she is simply dis allowing the fetus to continue living within her		doc344
The fetus		doc344
within the first trimester, is not a person.		doc344
Any creature with a nervous system has		doc345
feelings"		doc345
what I am referring to are thoughts and emotions		doc345
humans maybe parasites for the first nine months of their existence, but they are still human		doc345
Thus killing a human being		doc345
You made the point earlier that unborn babies are not human		doc345
but rather parasites		doc345
Unborn babies still fit the definition of		doc345
parasite		doc345
regardless of what trimester they're in		doc345
Do you contend that the unborn baby can be both a parasite and a person at the same time?		doc345
Are ing that a new born does not have thoughts and/or emotions		doc346
I did not say that the fetus is not a Homo sapien		doc346
No fair minded person will accuse me of saying such a thing		doc346
Thus killing a human being		doc346
You have not shown that this is morally wrong in any way		doc346
I said that fetuses are parasites		doc346
But I did not say that they are not Homo sapien		doc346
Get your facts right		doc346
a tick can both be considered an arthropod and a parasite		doc346
In any case		doc346
you still haven't shown that abortion is morally wrong.		doc346
Morality exists in the mind of the individual		doc347
I am only saying that abortion involves the killing of an innocent human being		doc347
If you believe that it is morally acceptable to kill innocent human beings, that is morality for you		doc347
prove		doc347
morality to someone who does not accept certain basic warrants.		doc347
I am so on the basis of Natural Rights		doc348
At some point		doc348
the living thing inside a woman's womb becomes a human being		doc348
I do not believe this to be at conception		doc348
and I cannot define exactly when that point is		doc348
But it is fairly clear to me that it is not one instant before birth		doc348
My daughter was born six weeks premature		doc348
If she had not been premature, would it have been legitimate to abort her two weeks later		doc348
Would it be legitimate for a woman to delay labor via drugs and have her baby aborted past the time it was actually due		doc348
And finally		doc348
most late-term abortions amount to clear infanticide, as the baby is actually living outside of the womb before it is killed		doc348
Must I accept this in order to be		doc348
pro-choice		doc348
in your eyes		doc348
Must I oppose a first-trimester abortion of a rape or incest victim in order to be		doc348
pro-life"		doc348
You make the argument that		doc348
pro-life		doc348
people should be for legal abortion		doc348
since legal abortion leads to fewer abortions and deaths of mothers having abortions		doc348
I question these data		doc348
Most of the countries where abortion is illegal are poorer and have other problems -- it is thus hard to isolate the effect of abortion laws on abortion rates		doc348
for the sake of argument, let's say you are right		doc348
Would this then also justify any other crime		doc348
What if the legalization of murdering one person a year was demonstrated to reduce the total number of violent crimes -- could it be justified		doc348
You are using utilitarian ethics		doc348
whereas many non-religious and some religious abortion opponents use Natural Rights ethics		doc348
Utilitarianism allows for any abrogation of rights if it can be seen as being		doc348
in the common good,		doc348
whereas Natural Rights allow for no such abrogations		doc348
There is nothing hypocritical about being a Natural Rights-based opponent of abortion.		doc348
It shouldn't be legal there are ways the baby can have different parents that can raise it.		doc349
